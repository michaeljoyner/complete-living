<p>Because one of the primary roles of Vitamin K is to assist in blood clotting, the chances of your levels being sufficient are pretty good, assuming your blood clotting process is normal. However, this level of Vitamin K may be sufficient to maintain normal blood clotting but it may not be enough to prevent other symptoms of deficiency.</p>
<p>Vitamin K has been found to be an important adjunct to the workings of Vitamin D and so if you are deficient in one, the other will not be able to do its job effectively. There has been research done on the role Vitamin K plays in preventing osteoporosis, coronary artery disease and cancer, indicating a need for further trials with this interesting vitamin. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three types of Vitamin K:</p>
<p>Vitamin K1 is found in plant sources, especially dark green ones. This type of Vitamin K is directed to the liver where it helps with blood clotting.</p>
<p>Vitamin K2 is made by the bacteria living in our gut (hence the importance of keeping these guys happy &ndash; see the article entitled &ldquo;Using diet, sleep and exercise to improve your gut health&rdquo;). This Vitamin K is used in the blood vessels and bones.</p>
<p>Vitamin K3 is a synthetic form which has been shown to causes toxicity and so should preferably be avoided.</p>
<p>If you have a personal or family history of coronary heart disease, eat a very restrictive diet, have poor gut health or a liver condition or take chronic medications, then you may need to consider increasing your Vitamin K intake either through food or from supplementation. Please note that if you have suffered a stroke or take blood thinning medication such as Warfarin, please get advice before starting a supplement.&nbsp;</p></div>
