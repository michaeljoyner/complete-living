This bread recipe is taken from Tim Noakes' cook book, the Real Meal Revolution. 'For those of you who are seriously considering trying a low carb diet, I strongly suggest you get your hands on one of these books - it will become your diet bible.<br><br>
The bread is made with flax seed, which once milled goes off very quickly and becomes toxic. Rather buy the un-ground flax seed and grind it as needed with a coffee grinder. That way you will not waste. <br><br>
There is only about 47 g of carbs in this whole loaf of bread. <br><br>
Because there are no preservatives in the bread, it will go off very fast. Once cooled (you must wait for it to cool completely before slicing it), slice it up and freeze the slices - that way you can use it as you need it and it won't go to waste.<br><br>
The recipe is a basic dough recipe, feel free to add any flavourings, cheeses etc!<br><br>
You will need:<br>
-	2 cups milled flax seed<br>
-	5 egg whites<br>
-	2 whole eggs<br>
-	5 tablespoons coconut or olive oil<br>
-	1 tsp baking powder<br>
-	1 tsp salt<br>
-	Â½ cup water<br>
-	3 g stevia powder<br><br><br>
Directions:<br>
1.	Pre-heat your oven to 180 C<br>
2.	In a mixing bowl, mix all the dry ingredients together.<br>
3.	Add all the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until well blended<br>
4.	Pour the batter into a greased loaf tin and bake for around 30 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean.<br>
5.	Leave to cool completely before slicing.<br><br>
* Tip - don't chick away those egg yolks, use them to make a home-made mayo, or cook them for your breakfast!</div>
