Got it? Great. Now I want you to ERASE THAT NUMBER FROM YOUR HEAD! In fact, while you are at it, please throw away your bathroom scale as well. I am about to explain to you why stressing about getting to that magic number doesn’t make sense.<br><br><br>
The body is made up of different components: bone mass, water and other fluids, organs, muscle and fat. When you step on a scale, the number that you see is the sum total of all these components. When someone says they are trying to “lose weight”, what they actually normally mean is that they want to lose fat. So now, if they are measuring their progress on a scale that is only telling them the sum total of all these body components, there is no way to tell that they are losing fat, and not losing, say muscle instead. <br><br><br>
Let me explain a common occurrence: Susan decides she wants to lose weight. To do this she starts a low calorie diet coupled with an exercise programme consisting of a lot of cardio (running, spinning etc.). This is a typical method followed by most people when trying to lose weight.<br>
After a month Susan sees that her weight has gone down by 4 kilograms, which she is happy with. Unbeknownst to her, she has actually decreased her body fat levels by very little and has burnt up some of her muscle stores. This is why the number on the scale is reflecting lower than when she started. <br><br>
So what is the big deal, she lost weight, who cares whether it was muscle or fat?<br><br>
Well, actually it does matter. The higher the amount of muscle our body has, the higher the rate at which it “burns” calories. Basically, more muscle means a higher metabolism. Besides this, more muscle and less fat means you look more toned, leaner and trimmer and you significantly decrease your risk of chronic disease.<br><br>
Lets look at another situation: <br><br>
Kate is the same age and weight of Susan. Kate seeks advice before starting her weight-loss programme. She is advised to not worry about weight but rather to look at muscle mass and body fat percentage. She starts an exercise programme consisting mainly of resistance exercises with a bit of cardio, and gets a tailored eating programme designed to help her “burn” fat and build lean muscle.<br><br>
After a month she checks her measurements (not on a bathroom scale but rather on a scale that measures weight, muscle mass and body fat percentage). She see’s that although her weight has only decreased very slightly, she has lost 2 percent body fat and gained half a kilogram of muscle mass. She feels great in her clothes and she can feel her body toning up and becoming leaner. She uses a measuring tape at home to measure her waist, around her arms and thighs and these measurements confirm that she is losing centimeters.<br><br><br>
Now imagine this scenario but in someone who does not have the background knowledge Kate has. She has been working out religiously, sticking to her diet plan but is still not seeing the “results” she envisioned on the scale. Meanwhile, she is actually losing body fat percent and gaining lean muscle! Without this knowledge, this can be enough for someone to just give up and go back to being a couch potato.<br><br><br>
If you used to think like this, I hope that this has enlightened you. If you do want to “lose weight” (i.e. body fat) and get into shape Fitlab boot camps are your answer. I am on hand to provide the nutrition advice you need and Bongani will get you fit in no time with his mix of resistance and high intensity exercises. <br><br>
