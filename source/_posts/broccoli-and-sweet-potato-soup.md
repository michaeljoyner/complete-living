The slow-releasing energy from the sweet potato will keep you going for the rest of the day, and your immune system will thank you for the boost.The recipe makes enough to last a few days, so work lunch will be one less thing to stress about! <br><br><span class="underLine">You will need:</span><br><br><br>
1 x large onion, peeled and chopped<br>
Canola oil for frying onion<br>
2 x large sweet potatoes, unpeeled and washed<br>
2 x heads of broccoli, chopped<br>

Nutmeg<br>
Salt and pepper<br>
250 ml cream/milk<br><br><span class="underLine">Directions:</span><br><br>
Poke the sweet potatoes with a fork several times each. Place on a plate in the microwave, and cook for 7 – 10 mins or until soft enough to cut through. Slice once cooked. <br><br>
Fry the onion in the canola oil for 5 – 10 mins, or until soft. Sprinkle nutmeg over while frying.<br><br>
Add the broccoli to the onion and cook for 10 mins.<br><br>
Add the potato to the broccoli, and pour over the water with the stock cubes mixed in.<br><br>
Leave to simmer for 20 minutes, or until broccoli breaks up easily.<br><br>
For a smooth consistency, use a stick or regular blender (cool first). Put the soup back onto the heat and stir through cream/milk and salt and pepper until desired consistency is reached.<br><br>
Once adequately re-heated, serve with crumbled feta on top. <br><br>
