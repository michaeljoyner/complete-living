<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/stress.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption">A common misconception</p>It is becoming more obvious through studies that stress is linked to many major medical conditions. Stress itself may not be a direct killer, but it definitely prevents the body from being able to stay well.<br><br><span class="underLine">How does stress make me unwell?</span><br><br>
The first effect stress can have on the body is ageing. It does this at a cellular level, by causing molecular changes in our DNA, which eventually damages the cells. This will not just make you look older, but it will also age the body systems, essentially causing the body to be more slow-healing and susceptible to disease, as an old person would be.<br><br>
Besides ageing, stress can also cause the neurons (nerve cells) to deteriorate and die, worsening brain function. Links have also been found between stress and cancer.<br><br>
Perhaps more relevant to nutrition and diet, stress can cause excessive abdominal fat, which in turn increases ones risk for diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. Let’s examine why:<br><br><span class="underLine">The link between stress, cortisol, weight gain and disease:</span><br><br>
When you are faced with a stressor (something which causes you stress), your body’s hormone-regulation system goes a bit crazy. The adrenal glands will release stress hormones (cortisol being one, adrenalin and catecholamines are others) into the blood system. Constant stress, and in particular the emotions of anger, anxiety and depression, will cause a constant and regular release of cortisol into the blood stream.  <br><br>
Cortisol speeds up the conversion of protein and fats into glucose, providing the body with the basic fuel it would need in a stressful situation (the fight or flight response). In this process, triglycerides are formed, which the body takes a while to clear from the blood stream. A high level of triglycerides in the blood stream has been linked to the development of heart disease and diabetes.<br><br>
Women who are frequently on diet have been found to have higher cortisol levels because of the stress of constantly restricting their food intake and counting calories. These women ironically gain weight in the stomach area (exactly the opposite of what they are trying to achieve), and it is thought that cortisol may be the cause. This isn’t only a problem to do with looks – weight gain in the stomach area has been proven to be associated with chronic disease development (such as diabetes or heart disease).<br><br><span class="underLine">Stress leads to poor lifestyle choices:</span><br><br>
An indirect way that stress can lead to weight gain and poor nutritional status is its link to poor lifestyle choices. For example, stressed people are more likely to smoke more, drink more, and make poor dietary choices. In addition, they are more likely to overeat.<br><br>
Stress may affect the way the body metabolises food, causing stressed people to put on weight more easily than non-stressed people. This weight gain is intensified if the stressed person is constantly eating junk food. Junk food is a common choice for the stressed, as it is seen as comforting. Caffeine and sugar containing snacks are also common, as people often think they will provide the body with energy in order to cope better. However, this may cause their nerves to jangle even more, and will send their blood sugar levels on a rollercoaster ride, eventually causing them to feel worse.<br><br><span class="underLine">The impact of stress on the immune system:</span><br><br>
Long-term or chronic stress wears down the immune system, supressing its response. This can make someone more susceptible to infections and illness. Even stress that is not long-term has an effect; for example it has been found that during exam periods, student’s immunity levels dip. It goes without saying that during periods of illness or infection, one is less likely to follow a balanced and varied diet causing their nutritional status to deteriorate. Links between stress and autoimmune and allergic disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma) have also been found. <br><br><span class="underLine">What ELSE does stress do to my body??</span><br><br>
SO much more. Muscle tightness. Tension headaches. Backaches. An upset stomach.  Poor sleep. Fatigue.  Irritability. Depression. Anxiety. Panic attacks.<br><br>
As you can easily imagine, someone who is suffering or feeling as described above, the LAST thing they feel like doing is following a healthy, balanced diet or exercising. And so they continue to comfort themselves with junk food and not exercise, which leads to them feeling worse. It’s a vicious cycle.<br><br><br><span class="underLine">I think I am stressed, what should I do?</span><br><br>
Identifying your causes of stress and dealing with them is the most obvious and important way of eliminating stress. In the mean while though, adopt these simple lifestyle changes – they will help you feel better physically and therefore emotionally, and you will find that you can cope with everyday life better:<br><br><br>
1.	Feed your body with foods it needs to thrive, not just survive:<br><br>
Eat balanced meals, using a variety of foods, regularly. Eat when you are hungry and don’t eat when you are not hungry. Keep it simple- forget about counting calories; once you have learnt what foods your body needs to function optimally, just focus on using these foods to prepare most of your meals. If you have no clue as to what these foods are, check out the article entitled “ Power Pack Your Trolley" in the blog section of this site. <br><br>
2.	Get out of the habit of categorising foods as “good”, “bad” and “forbidden”:<br><br>
This may sound a bit contradictory to the first point but hear me out: once you know what foods you should be eating as part of a nutritious and balanced diet and you eat them regularly, you won’t want to go back to eating how you were before. You will have more energy and your body will feel revived. However, everyone enjoys a treat now and again, I am no exception. If you consider a food as “forbidden” your brain will only want it more. It is important to include these in the diet every now and again to keep the balance. Once you have satisfied your craving, go back to eating well. Keep in mind the 90/10 percent rule: if you are eating well 90 percent of the time, you can allow yourself 10 percent of indulgence.<br><br>
3.	Move that body!<br><br>
It has been said time and time again, but only because it is true: exercise is a great way to beat stress. It boosts energy levels and lifts your mood. Besides that, it also protects the heart and helps to keep body fat levels low. You don’t have to rush out and join an expensive gym; walk the dog, play soccer with your kids in the garden, or best of all…..join Fitlab Boot Camps <a href="http://www.fitlab.co.za">www.fitlab.co.za</a><br><br>
4.	Take time for yourself<br><br>
Set aside time each day, just for you. Choose something you really enjoy doing, whether it is getting a massage, walking on the beach, reading a book or going to a yoga class. Switch off your brain to work, kids, husbands and wives and just relax. It’s critical that you take time out for your physical and mental health as no one else is going to do it for you.</div>
