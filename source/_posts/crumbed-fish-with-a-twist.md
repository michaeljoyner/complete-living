<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/coconut_crumbed_fish.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>This recipe comes from my new best friend, the Real Meal Revolution. To be honest, I was skeptical, I mean crumbing fish in desiccated coconut?!  Turns out it is both genius and delicious.  <br><br>
You will need:<br><br>
- 500 g white fish (must obviously be cleaned, de-scaled etc.), cut into 30 g chunks<br>
- 2 eggs, beaten<br>
- 2 cups desiccated coconut (I didn't try it but it may be quite nice to add some spices to the coconut to give it some extra flavour)<br>
- butter, coconut oil or olive oil for frying<br><br>
Directions:<br><br>
1. Dip each fish cube into egg and then into the coconut and set aside.<br>
2. Once all your fish is coated, eat up your butter/oil in a pan<br>
3. Fry each piece of fish until cooked through and golden brown.<br>
4. Serve with some home-made mayo and a big colourful salad.</div>
