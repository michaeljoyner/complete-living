    <div><img src="/assets/images/articles/allergies.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>Most of the time people merely have an adverse reaction or intolerance to a food as opposed to being properly allergic to it. So what’s the difference?<br><br>

Food allergy: the body’s immune system reacts to a substance found in the food that it identifies as being harmful. <br>
Food intolerance: A (normally unharmful) substance in a certain food causes an adverse reaction in which the immune system is not involved. <br><br>
So what actually happens in a proper food allergy?<br>
For some genetic reason, a few select people have differences in their cells that cause their immune system (which normally protects us from bacteria and viruses) to identify certain substances in foods as being harmful. Highly sensitive people can react to the smallest dose of the offending substance-even being in the same vicinity of the food can cause serious reactions. In others, they first need to eat the food to develop a reaction.<br>
Contact with the food causes the immune system to develop antibodies. When the antibodies come into contact with the offending substance again, the body is ready for it and the release of these antibodies causes the body to produce something called histamine. The histamine causes the physical symptoms of the allergy, such as coughing, sneezing, wheezing, rash, diarrhoea or congestion. In serious cases, a person can go into anaphylactic shock, causing a cut-off of the blood supply to the body, and will need emergency medical treatment.<br><br>
What foods are linked to allergies?<br>
There are hundreds of different foods which cause allergies but there is a group of 8 common offenders-they are most often linked to allergies. These are nuts, eggs, wheat, milk, peanuts, soy, shellfish and fish. <br><br>
A look at food intolerances<br>
Food intolerances can cause similar reactions to food allergies but the immune system is not involved. It is important to determine if the food intolerance is real. True food intolerances cause the predictable reactions of headaches, stomach pain and/or diarrhoea or swelling. <br><br>
So how do you tell if you are allergic or intolerant?<br>
If you suspect that you are allergic or intolerant to a food, it is important to visit your GP and a dietician so that they can do the necessary tests to determine what exactly you are allergic to. I can assist you with an elimination diet in order to determine what the offending food(s) are. From there, we will work on a diet together to make sure you are eliminating the offending foods but not putting yourself at risk for nutrient deficiencies. Don’t try it by yourself as you may be unnecessarily cutting out important foods.</div>
