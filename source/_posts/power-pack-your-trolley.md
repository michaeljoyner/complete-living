Proteins are the building blocks of the body and form an integral part of our diet.   Things from this group you should have in your trolley include: lean mince or cuts of beef, chicken breasts, eggs, oily dark fish such as salmon, sardines, pilchards, haddock, trout and mackerel, lean cuts of pork (such as pork chops), or ostrich meat.   Meat-alternatives include things such as soy products, tofu, legumes, seeds and nuts. Dairy products should include fat free cottage cheese, plain or Greek yoghurt, artificially sweetened yoghurt, low-fat or fat-free milk (cow or soya) and low-fat cheeses such as goats milk cheddar, feta and mozzarella.<br><br>
Things you should not have in your trolley include processed meats such as viennas, salami, polony, Russians or other processed sausages.   Avoid crumbed and frozen fish or chicken. Sweetened fruit yoghurt tends to have a lot of added sugar.   If you are vegetarian it’s easy to fall into the trap of relying on boxed, frozen soya products such as sausages and patties.   Unfortunately these tend to be high in salt, sugar and other additives.   Vegetarians must learn to use a variety of whole, unrefined foods, and should rely on commercially prepared food less often.  <br><br><span class="underLine">Starches/carbohydrates, cereals and grains</span><br><br><br>
This is the food group we are told to eat the most of, while limiting fats.   Unfortunately, this may not be the best advice as a lot of people tend to sacrifice the really important fats (such as mono-unsaturated fats) for starch foods that are high in sugar.   Some researchers are adamant that this advice is what is causing the surge in obesity and related diseases such as diabetes.  <br><br>
However, assuming that the correct ones are chosen, this group remains important and healthy.   Foods from this group that you should have in your trolley include: whole-wheat pasta/spaghetti, whole-wheat cous-cous, quinoa, barley, sweet potatoes, brown or basmati rice (rice mixed with split peas or lentils is great), whole-wheat or seed bread/rolls and wraps.<br><br>
Breakfast cereals can often be a huge sugar trap.   To avoid this, stick with things such as Swiss muesli, oats porridge and high fibre cereals such as All Bran Flakes.<br><br>
Things from this group that you should avoid are: cheesy breads/rolls, white bread/rolls, white pasta or rice, high-sugar cereals, cereal bars, pastries such as sweet and savoury pies, cakes, vetkoek, doughnuts, koeksisters, and commercial muffins and scones.<br><br>
Take note that a lot of the above products will often be labelled as low-fat to trick consumers into thinking they are a healthy product.   Be careful as they may be low in fat, but very high in sugar. <br><br><span class="underLine">Fruit and vegetables</span><br><br>
This is an obvious one - generally the more, the better. But be careful, there are one or two things you should be aware of.<br><br>
You can’t go too wrong with vegetables.   Try and get different colour vegetables, such as green broccoli, red beetroot and orange carrots.   This ensures you are getting a variety of vitamins and minerals.    A lot of people consider squash and potato vegetables, and technically they are.   Remember though that these are higher in starch than other vegetables, and so including them in a meal that already has a starch, such as rice, would be overdoing it.  <br><br>
Always go for fresh fruit over fruit juice or dried fruit.   Fruit juice and dried fruit have a high sugar content.   Fruit juice also does not provide you with the fibre that fresh fruit does.   If using tinned fruit, choose the one tinned in juice rather than syrup and drain the juice off before eating.   Although fruit does provide the body with vitamins, minerals and fibre,  some say that it should be avoided or limited as it is very high in sugar.   Please seek further advice on this if you are unsure.  <br><br><span class="underLine">Fats and oils</span><br><br>
Fats get a hard knock in the media - we are always told to avoid them,  and as mentioned previously,  good fats are often sacrificed for not-so-good carbohydrates.   However, good fats help to regulate our appetite,  essentially helping us to eat less.   They are also great for your heart and brain.<br><br>
Good fats that you should have in your trolley include:  olives, olive oil, avocados, nuts and seeds (almonds, sunflower seeds etc.), the fish mentioned under the protein section and sugar-free nut butters (such as peanut butter or almond butter).<br><br>
Trans-fats and saturated fats are the fats that we should avoid.   Saturated fats come from animal sources such as the fat found on meat,  skin of poultry, fat in full cream milk, yoghurt and cheese.   Trans-fats are man-made fats.   These occur when vegetable oil is hydrogenated, making it hard.   So foods that have a lot of trans-fats in include brick margarines,  processed and convenience meals,  savoury snacks and commercially baked foods (such as biscuits). <br><br><br>
The rule of thumb when grocery shopping and cooking is to keep your foods as fresh as possible.   Try your best to use fresh products when preparing meals as opposed to using a lot of boxed or tinned foods. <br><br>
