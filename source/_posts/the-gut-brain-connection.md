<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/gut_and_brain.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>You may be surprised to know that you are in fact more bacteria than you are human. That's right, humans have so many millions of bacteria living on or in them that we contain more bacterial cells than we do human. This is no reason to go and wash yourself right away - this is in fact a good thing! These bacteria play vital roles in maintaining our health and we wouldn't be alive without them. <br><br>
The majority of these bacteria live in our gut - this is referred to as our gut biome. Our gut biome is first established on our passage into this world when we literally take in mouthfuls of fluid on our way out - this sounds gross but it is one of the crucial steps in the process of a person building up their immune system and is one of the reason why natural child birth is preferred over cesarean sections. Contact with the mothers skin immediate after birth and breastfeeding are further ways of ensuring your baby's gut is made home to all sorts of health-promoting bacteria. <br><br>
As we grow up, many factors play into whether our gut biome stays healthy - these range from illnesses, antibiotic use, exercise and, of course, diet. It is these changes in the gut biome that have been connected to a wide range of conditions such as autoimmune diseases, metabolic diseases, gastrointestinal conditions and mental conditions. This may be very important in both the prevention and treatment of mental disorders and opens up a lot of avenue for future research and intervention.<br><br><span class="underLine">The link between the gut and the brain</span><br><br><br>
You may have heard the gut referred to as the second brain. This is because the gut is lined with millions of neurons, or brain cells. There is communication between the gut and the brain via several pathways, one of which is through the development of neurotransmitters, such as serotonin. The gut bacteria are vital in ensuring normal levels of tryptophan which is an important building block in serotonin. Serotonin is also known as the happy hormone; it gives a feeling of well-being and affects mood, social behaviour, sexuality, sleep, memory and appetite. The fact that more than 80% of our serotonin can be found in our gut and that those that suffer from mental disorders such as depression have low levels of serotonin further illustrates the link between gut health and mental health.<br><br>
Links between disturbances in the gut biome and neurologic disorders such as multiple sclerosis, autism, and Parkinsons disease have been identified. It is thought that these disorders may be caused by the pro-inflammatory state which is sparked by a poor gut environment. <br><br>
As with many things in the nutrition and health world, nothing is in black and white as yet. We do know that the causes and symptoms of some neurologic and mental disorders follow the same paths of progress and that an unhealthy gut can influence this progress in several different ways. It seesm very likley that gut health plays a key role in creating the inflammatory state that these neurologic and mental disorders need to develop.<br><br><span class="underLine">What makes a gut healthy?</span><br><br>
One must understand that there is no "gold standard" in determining a healthy gut and that my healthy gut may be different to the next persons health gut. Genetics and the different environments we live in means that there is a lot of variability in gut composition from one person to the next. As broad criteria, a healthy gut is one that contains the correct amount and type of bacteria to maintain structural functionality and essential metabolic and signaling functions. When ones biome shifts away from this, and one or more functions are not able to be maintained, this is termed dysbiosis. <br><br>
One symptom of dysbiosis is what is informally referred to as "leaky gut syndrome". What this means is that the mucosal gut barrier (which is normally kept in tact by the gut bacteria) weakens and potentially harmful molecules move through the gut wall and into the bloodstream. This will illicit an immune response as the body will identify these molecules as "foreigners". This immune response puts the body (and brain) into an unwanted inflammatory state. <br><br><span class="underLine">How can gut health be promoted?</span><br><br>
Keep in mind that the biome is started before we are even born. Pregnant women can influence the gut health of their child by what they eat and do during their pregnancy. Their choice of delivery and of whether they breastfeed or not will also play a role. A child who regularly uses antibiotics may have a weakened biome. <br><br>
The good news is that gut health is quite easily modified. Lifestyle factors, such as our diet, are key factors in the composition, diversity and stability of the bacteria in the gut. Several individual nutrients such as omega 3 fatty acids and the mineral zinc have been identified as having important roles in maintaining gut health. Sources of probiotics  such as fermented vegetables and kefir and probiotic supplementation also benefit gut health. The fermentation taking place in the gut has been shown to have strong anti-inflammatory effects and also produce various nutrients such as vitamins and antioxidants in the process. <br>
The elimination of sugar, refined foods and possibly gluten may also be very beneficial in getting your biome back to the state it should be.</div>
