<div><p>Some of these are obvious (everyone knows how much sugar Coke has) yet some may surprise you. Flavoured waters, iced teas and fruit juice may just be as bad as your fizzy drinks. Get into the habit of checking the label of your drinks: 4 grams of sugar is equal to 1 teaspoon. According to the World Health Organisation, men should have no more than nine teaspoons of sugar per day and women no more than six. This can easily be surpassed by just one or two of these drinks a day, and that doesn&rsquo;t even begin to account for all the &ldquo;healthy foods&rdquo; with sneaky added sugar.</p>
