<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/gourmet_granola.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>I know I have posted a similar recipe before but I just couldn't help sharing another one - I am so in love with this granola I could eat it 3 times a day. <br><br>
The recipe may not yield a huge amount but bare in mind that it is packed full of energy what with its nuts, seeds, coconut and coconut oil! All you need is 2 or 3 tablespoons on top of a thick, creamy Greek yoghurt with a few berries sprinkled over to give you a highly satisfying breakfast. You definitely won't feel that 10 am crash you are used to if you have been obediently eating your "high-fibre, low fat" cereal every morning!<br><br>
You will need:<br><br>
1 cup of pecan nuts, roughly chopped <br>
1 cup of almonds, roughly chopped<br>
1/2 cup sunflower seeds<br>
1/2 cup pumpkin seeds<br>
1/2 cup flax seeds<br>
1/2 cup coconut flakes<br>
1/2 cup desiccated coconut<br>
2 tablespoons goji berries<br>
2 teaspoons cinnamon<br>
1 teaspoon nutmeg<br>
coconut oil to coat<br><br>
Directions:<br><br>
1. Place all the nuts, seeds, coconut and berries in a baking dish<br>
2. Sprinkle the spices over<br>
3. Pour a bit of coconut oil over, and stir to coat all the ingredients<br>
4. Bake at 180 for 30 minutes, giving it a stir every 10 minutes. Its should smell brilliant by now.<br>
5. Cool completely before storing in an airtight container.</div>
