<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/FO1VUODHK6XCZFD.MEDIUM.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>Now don't freak out when you see the ingredients for this chocolate mousse. It has to be healthy somehow, right?<br>
Don't knock it until you try it, you will be amazed at the taste of the end result. If you counting calories, don't go wild. With the combination of coconut milk and avo, it is calorie dense so apply portion caution.<br><br>
You will need:<br><br>
- 2 - 3 ripe avo's<br>
- 1/2 cup coconut milk<br>
- 1/3 cup honey<br>
- 1/3 cup raw cocoa powder<br>
- 1 TBSP coconut oil<br>
- 1 tsp vanilla essence<br>
- pinch of salt<br><br>
Directions:<br><br>
1. Place all the ingredients into a bowl and blend until completely smooth.<br><br>
2. Serve immediately, or for a more intense chocolate flavour, refrigerate for a few hours or overnight  before serving.</div>
