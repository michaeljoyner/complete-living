Research has shown that poorer people tend to struggle more with weight gain than affluent people because of having to rely on processed, nutrient-poor foods. Unfortunately convenience and fast foods are often cheaper than buying real foods and cooking them yourself.  <br><br>
Some countries, such as Denmark, Hungary and France, have implemented "fat taxes" - a system which places tax on junk food and sugary drinks in order to curb the levels of obesity. It has been suggested that poorer people could benefit more from fat taxes as they would be more sensitive to price increases. Fat taxes are yet to reach SA shores, but in the meanwhile it is of benefit to everyone to learn to eat well on a budget:<br><br><span class="underLine">Plan ahead</span><br><br>
This is the golden rule of eating on a budget. Plan all your meals for the week ahead, and do your shopping all in one go. This will prevent you from buying things unnecessarily, allow you to make foods ahead of time (thus saving time)  and to use leftovers properly (so less waste). <br>
Make a list of all the meals you know how to cook and that you and your family enjoy. For each of these meals, write down the ingredients needed. At the beginning of each week use these lists to create your shopping list, omitting anything you already have. This prevents you from buying things that may go to waste.<br>
Set up a rotation system so that you are not eating the same meals on the same night each week, this will prevent boredom. Use the tools you have available, such as the internet, to look up quick and budget-friendly meals to add variety.<br><br><span class="underLine">Grow a green thumb</span><br><br>
There is no doubt about it - having your own veggie garden and fruit trees saves you money. You don't need a large area, even the size of a standard door will be sufficient to grow a few different types. <br>
Ask your local garden centre for help on getting started, or look it up online. Make sure you plant things that will grow well in your area. <br><br><span class="underLine">Manage your meats</span><br><br>
Meat is often the most expensive thing on the shopping list. Try to buy directly from a butcher as that way you cut out the middleman. Keep an eye out for specials - when there is a special purchase more than you normally would and freeze it. This may be expensive now but it saves you in the long run. <br><br>
Re-purpose your leftover meat - use the bones or carcass to make soups and stocks. Pull the leftover meat off a chicken to make into a wrap or salad the next day. Chop up leftover beef cuts to put into omelettes, soups or casseroles.<br><br><span class="underLine">Get friendly with tofu</span><br><br>
Follow the meatless-Monday rule and start to use tofu at least once a week. Tofu is made from soybeans, and it is a good source of protein. A lot of vegetarians use it as a meat replacement. It is also cheaper than meat. It is very bland on it's own but has a great ability for absorbing the flavours of the foods it is cooked with. Tofu also freezes well.<br><br>
Use it in stir fries, smoothies and curries - there are plenty of online recipes available.<br><br><span class="underLine">Buy in-season vegetables and fruits</span><br><br>
If you don't have the space for a garden and are forced to buy, make sure that you buy the ones in season. If they are not in season they will be more expensive as they have to be grown in special conditions, or they may be imported.<br><br>
Also use inexpensive vegetables, such as cabbage and spinach, as fillers in meals to stretch them further. <br><br>
Farmers markets are a good place to buy vegetables and fruits as again, you cut out the middleman. <br><br><span class="underLine">Bulk up</span><br><br>
When you can, order foods in bulk and store appropriately. For example, there may be a chicken farm in your area where you can get eggs and chicken at cost. You can freeze the chicken and store the eggs appropriately to last you quite a while. This is more of a cost upfront, but will definitely save you in the long run. <br><br><span class="underLine">Stretch your legumes</span><br><br>
Legumes are an inexpensive source of protein, vitamins, minerals and fibre. Use them to replace or stretch meat in stews, casseroles, curries and stir fries. Legumes come dried or canned - either way is fine. If they are canned buy the ones in water as opposed to brine, or rinse them off before using. <br><br><span class="underLine">Make your own baby food</span><br><br>
If you have a child under the age of 1 year, you may be spending a lot of money on commercial baby foods. These are expensive and completely unnecessary. Admittedly they are handy when travelling or when you are not at home, so save them for those occasions. Otherwise. it is simple to make baby food at home - for example boil pumpkin or butternut and dollop into an ice tray. Freeze and just thaw how ever many "ice-cubes" you need at once. This can be done for nearly every other type of food!<br><br><span class="underLine">Snack before you shop</span><br><br>
There is nothing worse than going grocery shopping when you are hungry. Everything is tempting! When your stomach is rumbling you will most likely buy things that you don't actually need. In addition, if you are hungry your blood sugar levels might be low causing you to feel shaky, tired and irritable. This leads to you chucking the first thing you see into your trolley so you can get out of there. Have a meal or snack before you hit the shops, and you will find it much easier to stick to the list.<br><br><span class="underLine">Dump the drinks</span><br><br>
For some reason, people don't see drinks the same way as food - many may not realise how may extra calories they are adding to their diet. The same goes for the food bill - drinks may increase the cost significantly. Cut out sugary drinks for the sake of your health and your wallet.</div>
