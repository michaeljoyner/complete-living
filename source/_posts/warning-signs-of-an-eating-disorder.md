title: WARNING SIGNS OF AN EATING DISORDER
description: Eating disorders, especially among school girls, are on the rise. Girls at an all-girls school may be more at risk than those at co-ed schools. High school aged girls are at most risk, although disordered behaviour and self-image issues are starting to be seen in primary-age school children. The earlier an eating disorder is addressed and treatment set in motion, the higher the chance of full recovery.

<div><p>I always get nervous when a school-aged girl comes to see me when there is no clinical or medical reason for their visit, but rather that they want to lose weight or learn to eat more healthily. This is especially worrying when upon assessment it is found that their body composition is well within the normal range and that they have (at least on paper) impeccable&nbsp;eating habits. This is not to say that every girl falling into this category has an eating disorder but it does indicate a red flag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good eating habits and healthy choices should most definitely be encouraged and supported by parents, but there are signs to look out for that these thoughts or habits are becoming restrictive and unhealthy. Here they are:</p>
<p><strong>Warning signs with regards to behaviour:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dieting behaviour (e.g. awareness of calories/kilojoules, skipping meals, avoidance of certain food groups or types such as starches, meat or dairy, replacing meals with fluids)</li>
<li>Excessive or compulsive exercise patterns (e.g. exercising even when injured, or in bad weather, refusal to interrupt exercise for any reason; insistence on performing a certain number of repetitions of exercises, exhibiting distress if unable to exercise)</li>
<li>Evidence of binge eating</li>
<li>Evidence of vomiting, diuretic or laxative abuse (e.g. frequent trips to the bathroom during or shortly after meals)</li>
<li>Categorising (writing it down or verbalising) &lsquo;good&rsquo; and &lsquo;bad&rsquo; foods</li>
<li>Changes in food choices (e.g. refusing to eat certain foods, claiming to dislike foods previously enjoyed, sudden interest in &lsquo;healthy eating&rsquo;)</li>
<li>Development of patterns or obsessive rituals around food preparation and eating (e.g. insisting meals must always be at a certain time; only using certain utensils/cutlery)</li>
<li>Avoidance of all social situations involving food, for examples friend&rsquo;s parties, and avoidance of meals (may say they have already eaten or have intolerances to certain foods)</li>
<li>Behaviours focused around food preparation and planning (e.g. shopping for food, planning, preparing and cooking meals for others but not consuming meals themselves; taking control of the family meals; reading cookbooks, recipes, nutritional guides)</li>
<li>Preoccupation with body shape and weight</li>
<li>Repetitive weighing or measuring of self</li>
<li>Avoidance of activities that she previously enjoyed.</li>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>Heightened anxiety around meal times</li>
<li>Depression, anxiety, moodiness or irritability</li>
<li>Low self-esteem</li>

<p>Should you identify your own child in any of these criteria, please do not hesitate to send me a message and I will do my best to guide you on the steps to take. &nbsp;Many people struggle to understand an eating disorder. As a parent, you don't have to understand it to be able to offer your child the support they need to recover from it.</p>
