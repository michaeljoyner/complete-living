<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/food_and_mood.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>Depression, as defined by World Health Organisation, is “the feeling of sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, feelings of tiredness and poor concentration”. It is becoming one of the leading causes of disability and the World Health Organisation has red-flagged it as becoming one of the 2nd most common causes of disability by the year 2020.<br><br><br>
So if depression causes weight gain how exactly does it do this? It could be one of several ways: the person could be making poor food and lifestyle choices. It could be medication-related. Or it could be physiological:<br><br><br>
Depressed people have been found to have disturbances in their cortisol levels (they are elevated) and sex hormones (they are lower than normal). This is caused by dysregulation of their adrenal system.  In addition to this, depressed people tend to have a higher level of inflammation in their bodies. These abnormalities are (coincidentally?) also seen in people with abdominal obesity.<br><br><br>
Based on the above, studies have tried to investigate why these abnormalities are seen in both depressed people and those with abdominal obesity people, and what the link is. It is hypothesised that chronic stress and/or depression leads to elevated levels of cortisol circulating through the body. The effect of the cortisol on the adrenal system causes fat to be deposited and accumulate in the abdominal area. A study which examined subjects over 5 years found that depressed people had a significantly increased risk of gaining weight in the abdominal area specifically (as opposed to general weight gain) as compared to non-depressed people. <br><br>
This relationship may explain why depression is often followed by diabetes or heart disease. It is well-known that abdominal fat (as measured by an increased waist circumference) is an independent risk factor for the development of these chronic diseases.<br><br>
In addition to appropriate medication (if necessary) and psychotherapy, the diet has a huge role to play in controlling one’s mood. Specific nutrients have been linked to the release and proper functioning of certain neurotransmitters. Yes, by simply changing up your diet a bit you can control depressive symptoms. This can also protect you against the burgeoning belly seen in depressed people and the risk of chronic disease that comes with that. <br><br><br><span class="underLine">Get your chef hat on:</span><br><br>
Try to cook at least one meal a day for yourself. This not only ensures you are getting at least one decent meal made with (hopefully) fresh and unprocessed ingredients but it also gets you to take an active role in looking after yourself – think of it as positive reinforcement. Your meal doesn’t have to be gourmet by any means – just make sure you use quality ingredients. <br><br><br><span class="underLine">Get friendly with fish</span><br><br>
It is well known that most of us do not get enough omega 3 fat in our diet. In fact we get too much omega 6. You will recall that earlier I mentioned that depressed people and those with high levels of abdominal fat have higher levels of inflammation. This could be made worse by eating too much omega 6 (an inflammatory fatty acid) and too little omega 3 (an anti-inflammatory fatty acid). Omega 6 is found in seed oils, such as sunflower and corn oil. These oils are commonly consumed due to our current dietary guidelines encouraging us to “choose vegetable oils over animal fats”, a guideline which could be doing more harm than good.  <br><br>
My advice is to dump the seed oils and to increase your omega 3 intake. Great sources of omega 3 are dark oily fish such as anchovies, sardines, fresh tuna, herring, mackerel, salmon and pilchards. Other sources include flax seed, walnuts, brussel sprouts, pumpkin seeds, spinach, kale and watercress. If you find you don’t eat a lot of these foods on a regular basis it is worth considering a supplement – a 1000 mg capsule of omega 3 (make sure it is from a fish source such as salmon oil, and that it is omega 3 on its own not in combination with omega 6) should suffice. <br><br><br><span class="underLine">Cut down on all carbs, and exclude sugar completely:</span><br><br>
Despite current blanket dietary guidelines encouraging us all to make carbohydrates, especially grains, the basis of our diet, many of us don’t metabolise these foods properly. This causes abdominal weight gain, fatty liver and increases ones risk of heart disease. <br>
Apart from this, sugar and refined carbs cause the blood sugar levels to go on a roller-coaster ride. This causes mood swings, irritability and the insulin surges causes further abdominal weight gain. <br>
By cutting out all junk, convenience and processed food you should automatically cut out a lot of added sugars and refined carbs. But it is easy to get caught out with so-called healthy foods as well – low-fat yoghurt for example is normally laden with added sugar, and fresh fruit juice is incredibly sugar-rich. For more info on how to navigate the mine-field on what is avoiding sugar in this day and age, check out the articles “How to become a sugar detective” and “Sugar, Sugar”  on my blog. <br>
Try to get your carbs mostly from vegetables, a little fruit and dairy. If you don’t want to exclude starches completely then make sure you choose the ones that are as unrefined as possible – sweet potatoes, barley, brown or long-grain rice and quinoa. <br><br><br><span class="underLine">Eat the rainbow:</span><br><br>
Many vitamins, minerals and antioxidants have been linked to the function of various neurotransmitters in the brain. An easy way to ensure you are getting a good spread of these is to choose as many different colours as possible – and the richer the colour the better. Think dark green spinach, a rich red beetroot and a bright yellow pepper. Obviously the fresher the better – try to find out the day your local grocery shop gets their fresh stock in as then there is less chance it has been sitting in a cold room for a while.<br><br><br><span class="underLine">Eat real food</span><br><br>
One of my favourite quotes is from Prof Tim Noakes. It goes “Eat real food. Real food is something that was alive until very recently”.  When you are shopping for food, keep it as fresh and as unprocessed as possible. This cuts out the additives and preservatives used in processed and convenience foods, which are linked to impaired brain function and ill health. <br><br><br><span class="underLine">Move that butt:</span><br><br>
Despite most people’s beliefs, exercise has very little to do with weight loss. So this guideline doesn’t have anything to do with getting rid of that belly – that is all to do with diet. It is to get that release of “happy hormones” or endorphins released in the brain when one is physically active. In addition, it allows you to take an active role in your health, giving you a feeling of control. What type of exercise depends on your state of mind – walking around the block, exercising in the privacy of your own home or joining a group class or gym are all options.</div>
