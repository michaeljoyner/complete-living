<p><strong><u>Juice them</u></strong></p>
<p>Some people immediately cringe at the thought of any kind of veggie juice, especially a dark green one. There is no need for a green juice to taste gross though, add a touch of sweetness with a little fruit or fruit juice and add some alternative flavours such as lemon&nbsp;or ginger. Here is a recipe to get you started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apples - 2 medium</li>
<li>Celery - 3 stalk, large</li>
<li>Cucumber - 1 cucumber</li>
<li>Ginger Root - 1/2 thumb</li>
<li>Lemon - 1/2 fruit</li>
<li>Lime - 1 fruit</li>
<li>Parsley - 1 bunch&nbsp;</li>
<li>Spinach - 2 cup&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Juice/blend all the ingredients together and drink immediately. Makes 2 servings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Add them into sauces and pestos</u></strong></p>
<p>Keep a bag of chopped greens in your freezer and throw them into tomato based sauces. You can also make a pesto to use with cheese and crackers or on top of fish or chicken. Here is a recipe for a spinach pesto:</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>100 g baby spinach</li>
<li>&frac12; cup pecan nuts, roughly chopped</li>
<li>2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese</li>
<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
<li>1 garlic clove</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Put half the olive oil and the garlic clove in a blender. Blend for a minute.</li>
<li>Add the spinach, pecan nuts, salt and pepper and blend until it is a rough puree. Add the parmesan and the rest of the olive oil and blend.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>Add them to soups and stews</u></strong></p>
<p>Or any one-pot dish that you are making. Cook up a big batch of veggie soup on a weekend and then freeze it in individual servings. Take this along to work to sip on in the late afternoon when the slump hits. Here is a recipe for broccoli and spinach soup:</p>
<p>2 leeks, chopped</p>
<p>4 tablespoons butter</p>
<p>salt and black pepper</p>
<p>6 cups vegetable broth</p>
<p>1 bunch broccoli, chopped</p>
<p>1 small sweet potato, peeled and chopped</p>
<p>150 g spinach</p>
<p>Directions</p>
<ol>
<li>Cook the leeks in the butter with &frac34; teaspoon salt and &frac14; teaspoon pepper in a large pot over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
<li>Add the vegetable broth, broccoli, and potato. Simmer until tender, 18 to 22 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in the spinach until wilted. Transfer the mixture to a blender and puree until smooth. Optional: stir in some sour cream before serving.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Use them as a wrap</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Toss the refined carb wraps and instead use a large dark lettuce, cabbage or spinach leaf to wrap up chicken strips, steak strips, fish or cheese as a nutrient-dense lunch. If you are using a tough leaf such as spinach, remove the hard end then blanch the leaves in some hot water for a minute, pat dry and then wrap him up! Here is a recipe for chicken or pork wraps:</p>
<p>For the chicken/pork:</p>
<p>- 500 g worth of chicken breasts/pork fillet, cubed</p>
<p>- 1 tablespoon of soy sauce</p>
<p>- 1 tablespoon of olive oil</p>
<p>For the salad:</p>
<p>- 1/2 cucumber, cut into julienne strips</p>
<p>- 1 cup of grated carrot</p>
<p>- 3 spring onions, diced</p>
<p>- 2 cups of baby spinach</p>
<p>- 1 tablespoon sesame seeds</p>
<p>- Salt, to taste</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Directions</p>
<ol>
<li>Toss the chicken/pork in the olive oil and soy sauce and cook in a medium-hot pan. Set aside.</li>
<li>To make the salad, combine the cucumber, carrot, baby spinach, spring onion and sesame seeds in a bowl. Add 1 TBSP of home-made lemon and olive oilf dressing and combine.</li>
<li>Put 3 -4 chicken/pork pieces and 2 &ndash; 3 TBSP of salad in your leaf of choice, roll up the leaf and eat immediately.</li>
