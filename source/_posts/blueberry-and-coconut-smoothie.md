    <div><img src="/assets/images/articles/images.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>A super smoothie if there ever was one: berries to give you a kick of antioxidants and some fibre, milk and yoghurt to top up your calcium levels and coconut cream and/or milk to give you immediate energy! <br><br>

You will need:<br><br>

- A handful of frozen blueberries (you can use any frozen berries really!)<br>
- 75 ml coconut cream<br>
- 2 heaped tablespoons of double-cream Greek yoghurt<br>
- 125 ml full cream milk/ coconut milk<br>
- A few ice cubes<br><br>
  Direction:<br><br>
  Whiz all the ingredients together and enjoy!<br><br>
  Consider adding a few more super foods for some variation: avocado (don''t knock it till you try it - it provides a divine texture and is a great fat source!), almonds, macadamias, goji berries, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds!</div>
