    <div><img src="/assets/images/articles/pregnancy.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>Being pregnant is one of the most exciting times in a women’s life, but it does take a huge toll on her body: her uterus will expand to 500 times its size, her blood volume will increase by 50 percent, her skin pigmentation will change, her bones will soften and of course she will gain weight. <br><br><br>

Many women make the mistake of treating being pregnant as a reason to eat more and to exercise less. As a result, many women end up gaining a lot more than the average 11 kilograms recommended (this may need to be less if you were overweight before falling pregnant). And as most people know, once baby arrives, life can become overwhelmingly frantic and a sleep-deprived and busy mom often has little time to prepare healthy meals or to exercise. And so, the weight continues to increase or stays right where it is. <br><br><br>
Let’s start with exercise: <br><br>
The school of thought that exercise during pregnancy will lead to a miscarriage or early birth is a bit old-fashioned. In saying that, always get the advice of your doctor, especially if you were not particularly active before falling pregnant. A woman who exercised regularly pre-pregnancy is more likely to cope with exercise during pregnancy, whereas an unfit woman runs the risk of injuring herself or causing harm to the baby if a strenuous exercise programme is suddenly started.<br><br><br>
The American College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology recommend moderate activity of thirty minutes three times a week. Examples of such activity would be walking, light jogging, swimming and yoga. It goes without saying that any activity where there is a risk of falling or trauma to the abdominal area is to be completely avoided. This would be activities such as horseback riding and gymnastics. In addition, over-exercising will cause stress to the mother and baby. Pregnant women should also take extra care when exercising in hot weather, and hydrate appropriately. <br><br><br>
The benefits of regular and appropriate exercise during pregnancy are numerous: improved mood, improved posture, maintenance of muscle tone, improved sleep and a better ability to cope with labour. A fit woman is also more likely to be able to cope with a natural birth and lessen their chance of having to have a caesarean section. <br><br><br>
What about benefits to the baby? Too name a few: the avoidance of a too-low or too-high birth weight and the maintenance of a protective placenta due to an increased surface area, volume and functional capacity. What about the long term benefits? Some research has indicated that children of exercising women had better weights and body fat levels, improved language skills and higher IQ scores.<br><br><br>
In a nutshell, all women with uncomplicated pregnancies should exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle before, during and after pregnancy. This will help to maintain the health of mother and baby on an individual level and help to combat the ever-rising obesity levels observed worldwide. <br><br><br>
Now what about the diet?<br><br><br>
As mentioned earlier in the article, many women use the fact that they are pregnant as a reason for eating a bit more than what they normally would, or eating foods they wouldn’t normally choose. The old saying of “eating for two” implies that a woman can do just that – eat double the amount they normally would.<br><br><br>
In fact, a pregnant woman only needs about an extra 300 - 450 calories (1200 - 1880 kJ) per day, and then this is only from the second trimester on when the increased nutritional demands of the foetus begin to increase the mothers appetite. During the first trimester, no additional calories are needed.<br><br><br>
Putting these calories into food terms may make it easier to understand. Before we do that, let’s stress the importance of the quality of these nutrients: everything the mother is eating is being passed onto baby. These nutrients are vital for the growth and development of the baby, not only in the uterus, but also long after birth. Research has indicated that poor nutrition before and during pregnancy can have an effect on the child later on in his or her life.<br><br><br>
Therefore, you want to choose extra foods that are nutrient dense; and avoid foods that provide calories and little else (such as sweets, chocolates, chips etc.). Here are some examples of appropriate snacks with their caloric value:<br><br><br>
• 1 – 2 tablespoons of raw almonds – 163 calories (almonds are a good source of fibre, calcium and monounsaturated fats)<br>
• 1 matchbox sized piece of cheddar cheese – 113 calories (cheese is a good source of protein and calcium)<br>
• ¼ avocado pear, salted – 80 calories (avo is full of healthy monounsaturated fats and Vitamins E, C and B)<br>
• 170 g tub of Greek yogurt with ½ cup of frozen berries – 130 calories (yoghurt is a good source of protein and calcium and berries are full of antioxidants)<br>
• 2 seed crackers with cheese – 200 calories (seeds are a good source of minerals, fibre and healthy fats)<br><br><br>
Choosing snacks such as these ensures the intake of quality nutrients that your baby can really benefit from. Using up your extra calories with sweet, chips and other such foods makes you sluggish, increases the chance of excessive weight gain and is provides very little nourishment to your child.</div>
