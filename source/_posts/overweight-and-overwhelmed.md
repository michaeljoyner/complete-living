<div>You have probably heard it before but here is a reminder: being overweight or obese bares many risks. Here they are in a nutshell:<br><br>
-insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes<br><br>
-heart disease<br><br>
-kidney and liver disease<br><br>
-polycystic ovarian syndrome<br><br>
It is possible to be overweight or obese and never develop any of those problems. So what's the big fuss? Overweight or obese people tend to have a lower quality of life-they may suffer from joint or back pain, they may battle to sleep properly, they fatigue easily and they may take longer to recover from illnesses such as flu.<br><br>
How do you know if you are overweight or obese:<br><br>
1. Work out your Body Mass Index (BMI). Take your weight and your height and use the<br>
following equation to work out your BMI.<br><br>
BMI = weight/(height)2<br><br><div class="art_pic_wrapper_big">

</div>
<br><br>
2. Location of excess fat plays an important role in determining your risk of developing any of<br>
the above conditions. Abdominal fat (the fat around your stomach area) has been shown to<br>
be the worst offender. Use a tape measure to work out your risk.<br><br>
Start by removing your clothing-the more naked the better. Get someone to help you to<br>
wrap the tape measure around your middle, in line with your belly button. Donâ€™t pull too<br>
tight-the tape should be firmly on your skin but not cutting into it. Use the following to<br>
assess your risk of complications:<br><div class="art_pic_wrapper_big">

</div>
<br>
There is light at the end of the tunnel... by losing even just 5% of your current weight, you significantly decrease your risk of any of the mentioned complications. And I promise you, it is easier than you think. There is no starving or running on the treadmill for hours, just simple and practical lifestyle changes.</div>
