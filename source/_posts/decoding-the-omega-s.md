<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/hunter-gatherer.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption">Channel your inner hunter-gatherer</p>You may have heard or read about the abbreviations EPA, DHA and ALA and wondered what they meant. These are the essential fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, collectively known as omega 3 fatty acids (n-3). Besides being a mouthful to say, these fatty acids are really important in the diet as the body cannot make them. So what exactly do they do then?<br><br>
Where to begin? n-3’s have a wide variety of functions in the body, most of them protecting us from diseases such as heart disease and strokes. This is thanks to n-3’s anti-inflammatory effects in the body. n-3’s also play important roles in brain function as well as skin and joint health. <br><br><span class="underLine">Where does one get these magical fats from?</span><br><br>
As I mentioned earlier n-3’s need to be provided by the diet as the body cannot manufacture them. Some foods contain ALA, which then needs to be converted into DHA and EPA. These are foods like dark green leafy vegetables such as kale, spinach, brussel sprouts and watercress, and oils such as flaxseed oil. It is estimated that the conversion rate of ALA to EPA and DHA can be as low as 5 % and that is why it is recommended that you also eat foods rich in EPA and DHA themselves. Certain oily fish are really rich in EPA and DHA -  those such as salmon, sardines, fresh (not tinned) tuna, mackerel, herring and halibut. <br><br>
If you thinking "gross I hate fish!" you are not alone. A lot of people battle to make sure they have the recommended 2 – 3 servings of oily fish per week. This may be due to taste preferences, or geographical reasons. A lot of foods such as eggs, margarines and peanut butters are fortified with n-3’s, check the labels. Supplements are also an option for the non-fish lovers; speak to a dietician about which kinds/brands are the best, as with a lot of supplements these days it is easy to get ripped off. Also, fish oil supplements are not recommended for people taking certain medications, so make sure you speak to someone in the know.<br><br><span class="underLine">The other omega:</span><br><br>
You would surely have heard about omega 6 (n-6), which is also an essential fatty acid. n-6 and n-3 work in conjunction and so both are important in the diet. n-6 has kind of the opposite effect of that of n-3 as it is pro-inflammatory. Now this is where the problem comes in……<br><br><span class="underLine">We need to take a leaf out of our ancestors book:</span><br><br>
Many, many years ago when we were still hunter-gatherers, we ate n-3 and n-6 in the perfect ratio: pretty much 1:1. However, since the advent of the vegetable seed oil industry, we have begun to eat waaaaaaaaaay more n-6 than n-3. This is because vegetable oil is pretty much used in every food product you can buy (apart from whole foods). Just look at how many labels contain the words "vegetable oil" in the ingredient list. This is something which is easy to assume is healthy. Not only is vegetable oil used in many food products, the seeds which are used to make the oil are fed to the livestock which we subsequently eat. This changes the fatty acid profile of the meat, meaning we automatically are eating meat higher in n-6. The perfect ratio of our hunter-gatherer ancestors? It has now swung in the wrong direction, with n-6 far outweighing n-3 at between 10 and 20:1!<br><br><span class="underLine">So what is so bad about us eating more n-6 than n-3…it’s also an essential fatty acid right?</span><br><br>
Yes, it is an essential fatty acid but recall that it and n-3 work in concert and need to balance one another out. Basically n-6 and 3 compete in the body for the same conversion enzymes, and so if you are eating a lot of n-6, less n-3 can be converted into the end products which protect us from disease. n-6 has pro-inflammatory effects, and so the more you eat the more is converted and the more inflammation happens in the body. It is no coincidence that since the food industry has been using it in abundance in their products, diseases like heart disease, cancer, diabetes and strokes have increased.<br><br><span class="underLine">So where are n-6’s found?</span><br><br>
n-6’s are found in vegetable oils such as grapeseed oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, and corn oil. You will be shocked to know how many products contain these in high amounts (remember that food labels are listed in descending amounts, the closer to the top the list the more of that ingredient the food contains). Just because these oils have a healthy sounding name in front of them, bear in mind eaten in excess they can be fatal.<br><br><span class="underLine">Ok so how do I make sure I am getting the correct ratio of n-6 to n-3?</span><br><br>
As I mentioned above our intake of n-6 to n-3 is between 10 and 20:1, whereas it should be much closer to 2 to 3:1. <br>
It is simpler than you think: learn which foods are high in n-3 and include those, learn which foods are high in n-6 and decrease those. If you feel you need a supplement, as I said seek advice as to which brands are best (it needs to contain the right kind of oil in the right amount).
