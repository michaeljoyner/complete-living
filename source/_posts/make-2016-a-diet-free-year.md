<div><p>After an indulgent festive period, many people have undoubtedly already vowed to make 2016 the year that they stick to a diet and lose the weight that crept on during 2015. This is the same resolution they made in the beginning of 2015. And 2014. And 2013. Why is it that this is so common and where is everybody going wrong that they have to keep starting from scratch at the beginning of each year? This may provide you with some insight into the problem&hellip;</p>

<p>Stop looking for the next best &ldquo;diet&rdquo;. As I tell everyone that comes to see me, diet is a filthy four-lettered word and it is not to be used in my office. It is easy to be sucked in by the advert of the fat sad-looking person (i.e. poor lighting, unflattering clothes, pushing stomach out) standing next to their happy&ldquo;transformed&rdquo; selves (i.e. good lighting, self-tan, better posture and a skimpy outfit). Research shows that dieters more often than not regain most, if not more, of the weight they managed to lose while following the latest diet trend (juice diet, cabbage soup diet, meal replacement shake diet, fat burner diet, green-foods-only diet, blood group diet&hellip;take your pick). If something promises extreme results in a short amount of time, please be aware that you are likely to be sitting at a higher weight than what you are now a few months along the line.</p>
<p>Right, so now you understand that a sustainable way of eating coupled with regular exercise is probably what you need in order to achieve your weight goals. But focusing on that alone, and ignoring the mental side of things, would be like planting a tree and neglecting to water it.</p>
<p>Changing eating behaviours without addressing and changing thought patterns can cause any new behaviours to soon be abandoned. For example, why does your boss putting pressure on you at work cause you to reach for the pack of biscuits in your drawer? Why does something your friend says to you cause you to want to sit on the couch with a cup of tea and a slab of chocolate? Without acknowledging these thought/behaviour patterns and learning how to deal with them, you will have likely broken your New Year&rsquo;s Resolution by February.</p>
<p>Here are some points to chew on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop with the &ldquo;all or nothing&rdquo; thinking:</li>
</ol>
<p>Things are going smoothly and you have been making the right food choices and hitting the gym regularly. Then you have a long day at work and have to get a take-away for supper. Or a family member has a birthday and you have 2 slices of the chocolate cake. Or the run you organised to do with your friend is rained out. These are all very likely situations and it is possible to navigate through them, but if you have the mentality of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so weak, I can&rsquo;t do this&rdquo;, or &ldquo;this is too hard, nothing goes my way&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I have ruined my diet now so I am not going back to it&rdquo;, that is when you will run into problems.</p>
<p>Self-sabotaging thoughts can lead to failure, but only if you are not prepared for them. Things are guaranteed to get in the way of your perfect plan, so accept it won&rsquo;t be perfect and have in mind the tools and thoughts to navigate through these unforeseen events. Instead of giving up completely, tell yourself it is a temporary slip up and you are back on track. Having compassion for yourself will serve you a lot better in the long run than being a hard-ass on yourself.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Be aware of environmental cues:</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of us mistakenly believe that we have the willpower of a superhuman and that when we smell that pizza, get offered some cake at the office or the waitress brings us chips instead of a salad, that we simply won&rsquo;t give in. I have news for you: you probably will IF you haven&rsquo;t learnt how to deal with your potential inner saboteur. Mindfulness, a common therapeutic technique, is the practice of focusing one&rsquo;s awareness on the present moment while acknowledging and accepting how you are feeling. This can be a useful tool to use before allowing oneself to give into that saboteur. That said, life is about balance and nothing should be done in too extreme measures &ndash; allowing oneself pleasures regularly is part of a balanced and happy life.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Take it slow:</li>
</ol>
<p>The pace at which you eat is also an important factor to consider: wolfing down your lunch in front of your computer or shovelling in breakfast while trying to make children&rsquo;s lunches distracts your mind from the task at hand. If you don&rsquo;t give your brain a chance to register that your body is getting food, you will likely not feel as satisfied by the meal as when you sit down in a quiet calm environment and savour each mouth full. Research tells us that eating slowly allows us to feel more satisfied by the meal, reducing the chances of having seconds or eating soon again after wards. Avoid eating in front of the TV. Preferably sit at a table and eat at a pace that allows you to enjoy all aspects of the meal &ndash; the taste, the texture, the smell and the look of the food.</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell, don&rsquo;t be sucked in by the 2016 &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; diet. Find out for yourself how to follow a sustainable, healthy and most of all enjoyable way of eating. Once you know that, identify environmental and emotional cues that have in the past caused you to overeat or make poor choices. Your job? A relationship? Depression? With strategies in place to combat those, and with the realisation that you are human and slip-ups are OK and temporary, you are bound to have the best year ahead.</p>
