<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/teach_child_to_cook.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>It is always fascinating to me how many adults I come across in the practice who are unable to cook or are just not interested in doing so. In some cultures, the men have never had to cook as their mother/caregiver always did it for them. This is all good and well until they reach an age of independence and move out of home. All of a sudden they have to rely on themselves to prepare meals, and often end up turning to fast food chains or ready meals. In other instances, some people lead busy lives, leaving them little time to prepare meals from scratch; and now and again I come across someone who can cook but who would prefer to spend as little time in the kitchen as possible. <br><br><br>
Now, these being adults, it is not very often that they will change their attitude toward cooking. The saying about old dogs and new tricks often applies here. But children are like sponges and can learn almost anything at all. One of the best gifts you can give your child is to get them into the kitchen as soon as possible, boys and girls obviously! Now I am not talking slave labour here, rather just introducing them to different kinds of foods, different preparation methods, different tastes and different textures. Not only will you increase the chance of your child eating (and liking) a wide variety of foods (it goes without saying these should be healthy foods), but you will provide them with a set of skills that they will be able to use when they finally fly the coop.  They will be less likely to rely on take-aways and convenience foods, thereby preserving their health. Not to mention it will be easier on their (and your) pockets.  If you are not a fan of cooking, use this as an opportunity to teach yourself some new skills as well; you may find that you quite enjoy it. The feeling of accomplishment when sitting down to a meal you have made may be enough to encourage you to do it more often. Plus, in my opinion there is no better or simpler way for a person to improve their health: learn to cook using real foods.<br><br><br>
Before you panic, I am by no means implying that you need to spend hours in the kitchen, we are all tired at the end of a work day and standing for a further couple of hours can often be too much to face. In these instances, calling the pizza delivery place is a clear win.  Cooking does not have to be drawn out or overly-complicated; in fact the best meals are often created using the simplest ingredients in the shortest amount of time. <br><br><br>
Here are some tips on how to get your kids in the kitchen, creating a love for healthy home-cooked food:<br><br><br>
1.	If your children are still a bit too small to be using sharp kitchen utensils, get them to help you in the preparation stages, for example washing vegetables or fruit. In doing so, they will learn the different names and what they look like. You will be surprised at how many children these days are unsure of the names of fruit and veggies, let alone what they taste like! <br><br><br>
2.	Keep a positive attitude – no matter how nervous you are. If you are unsure of yourself or nervous that your child is going to do something wrong, your child is likely to sense your anxiety and feel very pressured. This will not create a situation they want to repeat. Don’t fret if things are spilled, chopped the wrong way or put in at the wrong time, this is how kids learn! Supervise them, keep an eye out for hazards but mostly let them do their own thing. The self-esteem boost and independence they get each time they present something the have done will benefit them far into their future. <br><br><br>
3.	Use cooking lingo, such as whisk, sauté and fold. You may think these words are too “grown up” for your child to understand, but your child is like a sponge waiting to absorb information. Learning a new set of words is adding to their skill set.<br><br><br>
4.	Balance out the recipe choices. A lot of children are understandably going to want to cook cupcakes, biscuits and other sweet treats. Allow them to do this with the understanding that the next time you get to choose the meal. Use your “turns” to cook a balanced meal using fresh, whole ingredients. Use different kinds of vegetables, meats, flavours and methods of cooking to get them used to eating a wide variety of healthy foods. <br><br>
5.	Encourage touching and tasting. This allows the experience to be more enjoyable for your child and also helps them to be more adventurous with their food choices. It also gives you the opportunity to teach them what foods come from where and what is safe to eat raw and what is not.<br><br><br>
6.	Lastly, be patient and expect a mess! Put your child in clothes you don’t mind getting messed on. Expect things to go a lot slower than what they would if you were doing it yourself, because it will!</div>
