<div><p>When it is hot, a salad at lunch time is perfectly enjoyable. It is a different story when the temperature drops as we tend to seek comfort in hearty and hot dishes. Unfortunately, these often tend to be high in calories. Couple this with the fact that it is more difficult to remain as active in the cold months and it means that a few kilograms have crept their way on by the time spring rolls around.</p>
<p>I have written about the benefits of bone broth before, as have many other sources. To sum it up: bone broth is nutrient dense, rich in minerals, contains collagen which is important for joint health, good for the immune stsytem and helps to maintain the health of the gut.</p>
<p>A soup made with a base of bone broth and a variety of vegetables is a perfect winter time work lunch. It is warm, satisfying and contains heaps of micronutrients to keep the winter bugs at bay. The best part of it is that you can make a large batch ahead of time to save you time in the mornings.</p>

<p>Here is how to do it:</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<p>500 g good quality chicken, beef, game or pork bones</p>
<p>1 carrot</p>
<p>&frac12; onion</p>
<p>1 stick of celery</p>
<p>1 bay leaf</p>
<p>5 peppercorns</p>
<p>1 head of garlic</p>
<p>Directions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Roast the bones at 180 degrees until they are lightly browned, about 45 minutes (you can use raw but roasting them gives them a lovely flavour)</li>
<li>Place the bones, including the fat that has dripped off into a slow cooker/pot with the other ingredients and cover with water.</li>
<li>Place the slow cooker on low or the stove on the lowest heat &ndash; the liquid should not boil at all &ndash; this makes it go murky and have a slimy mouth-feel.&nbsp; Leave it for 12 hours.</li>
<li>Strain through a sieve.</li>
<li>To make your soup for work, place the broth back in the slow cooker and add a variety of chopped vegetables. Add some crushed garlic and ginger mix, mixed herbs, salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Cook for a further few hours until the vegetables are soft. Use a blender or food processer to give the soup a smooth consistency and separate into bowls/containers. Freeze and defrost as needed.</li>
<li>After re-heating at work, stir in a little cream and some bacon bits, diced chicken or some crumbled feta.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
