<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/oat_and_pecan_nut_muffins.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>These oat and pecan nut muffins are guilt-free as they use apple sauce and artificial sweetener instead of regular sugar. The apple sauce provides both sweetness and moisture. <br><br>
Have one at breakfast, with a side of thick Greek yoghurt or as a mid-morning snack with some grated cheese.<br><br>
You will need:<br><br>
- 1 cup regular oats<br>
- 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce<br>
- 1/2 cup whole-wheat flour<br>
- 1/4 cup regular cake flour<br>
- 1 teaspoon baking powder<br>
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda<br>
- 1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
- 1 cup pecan nuts<br>
- 1 large egg<br>
- 1/4 cup baking-appropriate artificial sweetener (e.g. Canderal)<br>
- 2 tablespoons canola oil<br>
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br><br>
Directions:<br><br>
1. Pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius. Spray non-stick baking spray onto a baking tray, and sprinkle the oats onto the tray. Bake the oats for about 10 minutes, stirring twice. Remove from the oven and let cool.<br><br>
2. Crush the pecan nuts until they are broken up into smallish pieces.<br><br>
3. In a large bowl, mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together.<br><br>
4. In a separate bowl, mix the crushed nuts, egg, oil and artificial sweetener together.<br><br>
5. Add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, with the oats and the applesauce.<br><br>
6. Stir only until all the ingredients are well combined.<br><br>
7. Dollop into a greased muffin tray and bake for 12 - 15 minutes.</div>
