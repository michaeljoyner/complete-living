    <div><img src="/assets/images/articles/images_1.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>Looking for something quick but different to make for supper? These juicy chicken breasts are kept moist by the bacon. The bacon itself crisps up so well in the oven, your family will be fighting each other for it. Use your imagination for the chicken filling! <br><br>

You will need:<br><br>

- 4 large chicken breasts (can be on or off the bone)<br>
- 4 slices of bacon<br>
- 1 TBSP butter<br>
- Salt, pepper and mixed herbs<br>
- crushed garlic<br>
- whatever you want to fill the chicken with...I used cheddar and pepperdews but you could use spinach and feta, pesto, olives and cherry tomatoes.....go wild!<br>
- toothpicks for securing the bacon<br><br>
  Directions:<br><br>

1. Slice the chicken breasts length ways, but not all the way through, so that they open like a book<br>
2. Fill the chicken with your choice of filling and close it<br>
3. Season the chicken breast with salt, pepper, mixed herbs and some crushed garlic<br>
4. Lay a slice of bacon over the top of each breast and secure with a toothpick<br>
5. Melt the butter in a hot pan and cook each breast for a few minutes on each side. Be careful not to let all your filling fall out!<br>
6. Place the breasts in a covered oven dish in an oven pre-heated to 180. Cook for about 20 - 30 minutes or until cooked through.<br>
7. This is quite a rich dish, so serve with a crisp, fresh salad.</div>
