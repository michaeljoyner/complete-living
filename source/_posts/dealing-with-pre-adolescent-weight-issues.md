<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/preadolescent_weight_issues_1.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>If you identify yourself and your child as being in this situation, this is the question you are most likely asking: how do you, as a parent, help your child to develop healthy habits that will keep his or her body healthy and fit, without harming his or her self-esteem, without contributing to the development of disordered eating patterns or burdening him or her with issues revolving round food and body image for the rest of their lives? It might seem daunting, but here are some important things for you to consider and do:<br><br><br>
1.	Focus on fitness and not on appearance: Girls especially are under extreme pressure these days to look like the women they see on magazine covers and catwalks. Boys are not safe either, with many trying to emulate the muscular models seen on magazines aimed at men. Try to move your child’s focus away from looks, and focus it on fitness. Continuously emphasise the importance of being fit – muscular strength, cardiovascular fitness and flexibility all included. Encourage school and team sports, and make keeping active a family affair. Cycle together on weekends, or take a class together at the gym. <br><br>
2.	Keep the house stocked with the right foods and snacks: if that is what is available then that is what will be eaten. Don’t stock up on sugar or trans-fat laden foods such as crisps, biscuits, sweets or fizzy drinks – save those for once in a while treats. Rather have nuts, biltong, cheese, avo’s, yoghurt, eggs, leftover chicken, tinned tuna, nut butters, fruit and vegetables available to snack on. Lead by example as well: you and your partner should be eating the way you want your children to. <br><br>
3.	Stress the importance of identifying physical hunger from emotional hunger early on: children are born with an innate ability to stop eating when they are full. Unfortunately they soon grow out of it, and external factors such as advertising, friends and emotions begin to dictate when it is time to eat rather than their stomachs. Children may see fast food or such as a treat and they will test you to see if you will allow them to have it. Set limits on this, just as you would set limits on TV watching or internet-surfing. Don’t turn any kind of food into a “forbidden” item as that can cause issues later on, but explain that it is for special occasions. If your child is genuinely hungry they will not turn down your offer of a healthier meal or snack.<br><br>
4.	Be a role model: Your child is much more likely to develop issues around food and body image if you are constantly dieting and then breaking that diet. Resolve your own issues around your weight and health, or at least keep them to yourself. If your daughter sees you examining your body in the mirror and complaining about how you hate your butt/legs/stomach your daughter is likely to do the same to herself. Be confident in yourself, never bring yourself down, or any other women’s body for that matter. And never weigh yourself in front of your impressionable pre-teen. <br><br>
5.	Don’t deprive yourself or your child: food treats should not be an everyday thing, but when they do cross your path, do not deprive yourself or your child. Enjoy them. Depriving yourself or your child can lead to cravings later on. Never skip a meal because of a treat that was eaten earlier in the day – that is not setting up good eating habits. <br><br>
6.	Focus on and make known what you love about your child: always let your child know that you love them just as they are. Pay attention to things they do well, or chores they do without asking. They will flourish.  Give your child physical affection as well, and don’t let them look for this in a slab of chocolate or a bag of chips:  pre-adolescents can feel extremely awkward about their changing bodies so cuddle or sit with them often to let them know they are still your child. Spend quality time together. Your child is slowly becoming more independent, but work to keep the connection between the two of you – all they may need is to know that they are loved, listened to and accepted at home (especially if they are having a hard time at school).  <br><br>
7.	Limit the stress in your child’s life and ensure they have good sleeping habits: Your child may be having a hard time at school, and so may be stressed. This can increase their levels of cortisol, which can lead to an increased appetite and weight gain. Poor sleep or a lack thereof can do the same thing. If you pick up that your child is stressed, talk to them and help them to solve their problems. Ensure they have good bed time habits, putting away cell phones, tablets, and computers and turning off the TV a good while before bed. These stimulate the brain decreasing the quality of sleep. <br><br>
8.	Rethink your own views about body image: refrain from thinking that your child should fit a certain image. If you child’s weight, body fat level and height are within the normal ranges for their age, then that is wonderful. If they are not, then ensure you approach the situation carefully: chat to your dietician to see if weight loss is necessary, as maintenance of the child’s current weight may be sufficient to protect their health. If weight loss is necessary avoid telling your child that he/she needs to go on a diet. This will most definitely set up issues for them later life. Instead work as a family to ensure you are all following a healthy and balanced lifestyle.<br><br>
