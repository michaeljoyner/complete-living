<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/COFFEE_1.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>We began growing and trading coffee in the fifteenth century and since then the demand has grown substantially. It is currently the 2nd largest traded product after petroleum. Many countries grow coffee plant crops but Brazil and Columbia hold the largest share of the trade. <br><br><br>
Coffee is one of the most popular drugs in the world, consumed by around 90% of the population. This is largely because of its stimulatory effect it has on the body and the nervous system in particular:  simply put, the caffeine increases neuron activity in the brain. The pituitary gland recognises this as a signal to release adrenalin. The caffeine also increases the production of dopamine, a neurotransmitter which is a nervous system stimulant. It increases the blood pressure and heart rate. This is where the “kick” of a cup of coffee comes in. Caffeine has been shown to have similar effects on the brain as amphetamines and heroine do, but obviously on a much smaller scale.<br><br><br>
The debate as to whether caffeine is good or bad for us continues: there is strong evidence to tell us that the intake of caffeine decreases the rate of diabetes, heart disease, Parkinsons, Alzhemiers and certain cancers. On the other hand, there is research to suggest links between caffeine consumption and the development of cardiac problems and other forms of cancer.  <br><br><br>
Let’s break it down:<br><br><br>
The good:<br><br>
Related more to coffee in general rather than caffeine itself, the coffee plant has several components in which have been linked to the protection against cardiovascular disease and diabetes. In addition, the coffee plant contains potent antioxidants which protect against free radicals and thereby certain cancers, in particular liver, kidney, breast and colorectal cancers. More research is needed to determine exactly what it is in the coffee plant that is protective: some studies have used caffeinated coffee while others have shown positive results with decaffeinated coffee. The studies using decaffeinated coffee strongly suggest the antioxidant and protective effects of the other components, apart from caffeine, found in the plant. All in all, it is a step in the right direction to future cancer prevention and treatment protocols.<br><br><br>
As with cancer, caffeine along with the other compounds found in coffee, can have a positive effect in the reduction of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the fastest growing metabolic and lifestyle diseases in the world. The development of it is related to our poor lifestyles, poor diets, sedentary behaviour and obesity. It is thought that it is the antioxidants found in coffee, and the positive effect it has on the blood sugar and insulin levels that gives coffee its protective effect.  In a nutshell, we know that coffee (both caffeinated and decaffeinated) have a protective affect against diabetes, we are just unsure of the exact mechanisms it plays a role in to achieve this. <br><br><br>
Another area of research is the link between coffee and heart health. Again, studies have looked at caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee, because it is not caffeine alone that may have beneficial effects.  Positive results have included the link between coffee consumption and lowered risk of coronary heart disease, lowered risk of damage to the blood vessels, lowered inflammation levels and lowered calcification of the blood vessels.  All of these could be linked to caffeine itself, or the antioxidants found in the rest of the plant.<br><br><br>
The bad:<br><br>
As mention earlier, there is research available to suggest that coffee may not be all it is cracked up to be.  For example, some studies show a positive link between coffee and/or caffeine intake and the development of breast, laryngeal, lung, prostate and stomach cancer. In addition, some researchers claim there is a link between coffee and heart disease. However, one must take into account that some of these studies used an amount of caffeine that is in excess of what is recommended, for example 8 cups of coffee per day. Here it was shown that there was a positive link between coffee and an irregular heartbeat, a raised homocysteine level (a protein associated with the development of heart disease) and increased cholesterol levels.  It is possible that none of these affects will be seen if one sticks to the recommended intake of coffee per day.<br><br><br>
The bottom line:<br><br><br>
It seems likely that coffee (both caffeinated and decaffeinated) can exert beneficial effects in the human body.  It is important to take note of the recommended amount per day however, as an intake above this may cancel out the benefits. <br><br><br>
Adults should stick to 400 – 450 mg per day, pregnant women should limit their intake to 300 mg per day and children 4 – 6 years old should have much less at about 45 mg per day.<br>
Caffeine content of coffee can vary depending on how it was grown, manufactured and prepared. Here are guideline amounts though:<br>
30 ml espresso – 40 – 5 mg<br>
240 ml generic brewed coffee – 95 – 200 mg<br>
240 ml generic brewed coffee, decaffeinated – 2 – 12 mg<br>
240 ml generic instant – 27 – 173 mg<br>
240 ml generic instant, decaffeinated – 2 – 12 mg<br>
Tea, regular – 14 – 61 mg<br>
Green tea – 24 – 40 mg<br><br><br>
Of course, caffeine is not only found in coffee. It is found in carbonated drinks, energy drinks and chocolate as well.  Take note that because we are unsure as to whether it is the caffeine or the other compounds found in coffee, drinks that have only had caffeine added to them (such as the carbonated and energy drinks), may not have as a beneficial effect as coffee. Most importantly though, these drinks tend to have an incredible amount of sugar added to them, along with many other potentially nasty components. Quality dark chocolate (the darker the better, as it means less sugar) is a good source of caffeine and antioxidants, and can be regularly enjoyed in moderation (preferably with an antioxidant rich red wine ;) ).</div>
