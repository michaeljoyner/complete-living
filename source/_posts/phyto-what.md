<div><span class="mySubHeading">What is a phytochemical when it is at home?</span><br><br>
The word phyto means plant, and so phytochemicals are chemicals which are found in plants. Plant foods include vegetables, fruits and whole grains. There are thousands of individual phytochemicals known to man, and one food can contain hundreds. <br><br>
Phytochemicals play a variety of roles in plants:  they provide colour and flavour, they have structural roles, they act as hormones and they produce energy. The amount and type of phytochemicals available in a plant differs from plant to plant.<br><br>
Although not considered one of the essential nutrients for humans (because we wonâ€™t develop a deficiency disease if we eat too little of them), phytochemicals can be considered essential nutrients in that the body cannot make them (or at least not enough of them), and so they must be obtained from the diet. Research has shown that phytochemicals are excreted from the body a few days after ingestion, which goes to show the intake of them must be regular and maintained.<br><br><span class="mySubHeading">So what is the big fuss over phytochemicals?</span><br><br>
For many years the benefits of a diet rich in vegetables, fruit and whole grains was attributed to the vitamin and mineral content of these foods. We now know that there is more to it than just that. After discovering that vitamins and minerals cannot be the only reason for the health differences between those eating and not eating a plant rich diet, research has shown that phytochemicals play a very important role in disease prevention.  Thousands of phytochemicals have now been isolated and their benefits determined. Some of these include the prevention of cancers (lung, breast, throat, cervical, colon), heart disease, eye problems, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes, strokes and high blood pressure. <br><br>
How exactly do they do this? In a variety of ways: they act as hormone-inhibiting substances which can prevent the initiation of cancers, they act as antioxidants which repair damage to cells, they block they action of other substances which lead to cancer and other diseases, they modify the absorption and production of cholesterol and they decrease the formation of blood clots. <br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Surely they have made a pill with phytochemicals in, can't I just take that?</span><br><br>
Of course there are already hundreds of different phytochemical supplements available on the market. Unfortunately, like many things in life, it is not as easy as that. Scientists have discovered that phytochemicals cannot work in isolation, and that their absorption and utilisation depends largely on the presence of other phytochemicals and substances in the food. Phytochemicals act together to produce the desired effects in the body and because the optimal combinations are not yet clear to us, it is recommended that phytochemicals come from food and not from supplements. <br><br><span class="mySubHeading">OK, so what is the easiest way to ensure I am getting enough phytochemicals in my diet?</span><br><br>
The easiest way to make sure you are eating a diet rich in phytochemicals is to make sure you are eating different coloured vegetables and fruit - when shopping make sure you choose a variety of colours. The table below shows which foods provide which phytochemicals:<br><div class="art_pic_wrapper">
