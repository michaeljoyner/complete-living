<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/chicken_and_butternut_soup_1.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>Don't toss out the carcass of Sundays roast chicken - there is more to be done with it. Get 2 meals for the price of 1 with this chicken and butternut soup, which uses the carcass (and what meat is left on it) to make up the stock/base. <br><br>
You will need:<br><br>
- Leftover carcass of a roast/rotisserie chicken<br>
- Boiling water to cover chicken<br>
- 1 x butternut, peeled and chopped into small chunks<br>
- 1 x small sweet potato, unpeeled, chopped into small chunks<br>
- 2 onions<br>
- 2 x chicken stock cubes<br>
- salt and pepper to taste<br>
- Pinch of dried chili flakes<br>
- Pinch of dried oreganum<br><br>
Directions<br><br>
1. Place the chicken in a large pot and just cover with boiling water<br><br>
2. Simmer the chicken for 20 - 30 minutes. Remove chicken from pot and place on a chopping borad. Shred any meat off the bones and place back into the stock in the pot. Discard any bones/cartilage. <br><br>
3. Place the pot back onto the stove and add in the chopped butternut, sweet potato and onion. Also add the 2 stock cubes and seasonings.<br><br>
4. Simmer for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and blend until smooth.<br><br>
5. Once desired consistency is reached, place back into pot to re-heat slightly. <br><br>
6. Serve topped with crumbled feta and (if you not watching your carbs) a fresh whole-wheat roll.</div>
