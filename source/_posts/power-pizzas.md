These mini pizzas use galettes as a base. Galettes are cooked and look like crumpets, but are made with cream/cottage cheese, egg, oat bran and the desired herbs and spices. Galettes can be eaten alone, or with a meal, and are often used as a replacement for bread for those trying to follow a low carb diet.<br><br><br>
Here is how to make galettes.<br><br>
You will need:<br><br>
- 2 x tablespoons cream/cottage cheese<br>
- 3 x tablespoons of oat bran<br>
- 1 x egg<br>
- salt, pepper and any other desired herbs/spices <br>
MAKES APPROXIMATELY 5 - 6 GALETTES<br><br>
Directions:<br><br>
Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl. Heat pan with canola oil to a medium heat. Drop tablespoons of the mixture into the hot pan. Cook for a few minutes on one side until golden brown, flip and cook on other side. <br><br>
For the mini pizzas:<br><br>
Let the galettes cool for a few minutes. Spread a small blob of tomato paste on each galette. On top of each galette place sliced mushroom, diced and cooked bacon and cheddar cheese or whatever other toppings you want! Place under grill for 7 - 10 minutes, or until cheese is melted and crisped. Serve with a large side salad. <br><br>
