<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/collage1.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>This is a dish that combines the antioxidant properties of different coloured vegetables with the creamy delicious-ness of lasagne. For those of you counting carbs, this is also for you as instead of lasagne sheets (apologies to the Italians) sweet potato is used. It is both a comforting and highly nutritious meal.<br><br>
The recipe serves about 6 people, so it is perfect for a family or for those wanting leftovers the next day. It is also a great way to get kids to eat spinach – they won’t even know it is in there!<br><br><span class="underLine">You will need:</span><br>
For the savoury mince and base:<br><br>
1 onion<br>
A few cloves of garlic, chopped<br>
Half/small green pepper, chopped<br>
Half/small red pepper, chopped<br>
A cup of sliced mushrooms<br>
400 g tin of tomato and onion mix<br>
500 g of beef mince<br>
2 large sweet potatoes, unpeeled<br>
A large bunch of spinach<br><br>
For the cheese sauce:<br><br>
1 cup milk<br>
1 cup grated cheese<br>
1 tablespoon of cake flour<br>
A big pinch of salt<br>
Black pepper to taste<br>
2 teaspoons crushed garlic<br><br><br><span class="underLine">Directions:</span><br><br><br>
1.	Slice the sweet potatoes fairly thickly. Slice the spinach into strips. Boil or steam the potatoes and spinach (separately) until both are soft (the spinach should only be a few minutes whereas the potatoes will take a bit longer).<br><br>
2.	While the potatoes and spinach are steaming/boiling, start on your savoury mince. Fry the onion and garlic for a few minutes, add the mince and break it down with a fork, cook together for about 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper. Add the mushrooms and the peppers, and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the tinned tomato and onion mix, and let it simmer slowly for about 10 minutes. Add seasoning to taste if desired.<br><br>
3.	To make the cheese sauce, place the milk into a small pot (not on the heat yet). Add the cheese on top of the milk. On top of that add the flour, seasoning and garlic. Now put the pot on a medium heat, and whisk while it heats up. Continuously whisk to prevent lumps. Once simmering, let it simmer for a few minutes. Add a bit more milk if you feel it is too thick.<br><br>
4.	In a large oven dish, place your sweet potatoes, then then the spinach layered on top, then the savoury mince and then the cheese sauce. Add a bit more sprinkled cheese on top.<br><br>
5.	Place in the oven at 180 C for about 20 minutes or until golden and bubbly. <br><br>
Serve with a dark green leafy salad. Enjoy!</div>
