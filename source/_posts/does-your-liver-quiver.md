<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/liver_detox.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>The research around liver detoxification started out focusing on the 2 major toxins that the liver has to cope with: alcohol and drugs. Research has now moved onto looking at the relationship between long-term low level toxin exposure and the development of chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and certain gut diseases. <br><br><br>
But surely the body and the liver are designed to detox themselves? Yes they most definitely are. However, chronic exposure to toxins can have an effect in the long-term on the livers ability to detox efficiently. In addition, some people may be more sensitive to certain substances and we all detox at different rates.  Let’s quickly look at how liver detoxification works:<br><br><br>
Very simply put, we have a family of enzymes which live in our liver. They are responsible for identifying any foreign or toxic particle entering the liver and converting it into a water soluble particle that can be excreted from the body. This family of enzymes has 2 lines of duty: the first is general housekeeping by eliminating the toxins that our bodies make during its day-to-day functions. The second is dealing with the foreign toxins, be it something coming from what we eat or drink, something we breathe in or something we absorb through our skin or hair. <br><br>
If we overwhelm our body with these foreign toxins, the enzymes battle to keep up with all the work, and their general housekeeping duties start to be sacrificed. Over the long term, with it being exposed to a higher toxin level than what it is used to, the liver can start to suffer. This can manifest in all the ways explained above – chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, diabetes, obesity, depression and gut issues. <br><br><br>
So how do we support liver detoxification?<br><br>
In order to answer that, let’s look at the potential toxins we are exposed to:<br><br>
Toxins can come in various shapes and sizes, but one of the most obvious are processed foods and drinks, especially those high in sugar (especially high fructose corn syrup), preservatives and trans fats. This would be soft drinks, take-away meals, convenience meals, sweets and chocolates and confectionary (almost anything that is not fresh, natural or in a raw form). In addition to these, refined cereals and grains, industrial or refined seed oils (sunflower oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil etc.) and processed soy are also thought to be toxic burdens to the liver. <br><br>
Now, obviously the body can handle these foods in small amount, and you won’t (or shouldn’t) get sick eating them now and again. But considering that most people’s diets are largely made up of these foods, it is easy to see that liver disease is fast becoming one of the biggest killers. <br><br><br>
Gluten is another hot topic right now, and for good reason. It used to be thought that it was only necessary for people with diagnosed Celiacs disease to cut out gluten. But it has come to light that Celiacs disease is really only the tip of the ice-berg when it comes to gluten sensitivity and intolerance. Gluten has been linked to something called “leaky gut syndrome”, which is exactly what it sounds like: the gut becomes more permeable to pathogens and toxins moving through it and into the systemic circulation. This has been linked a number of conditions such as autoimmune diseases, ADHD, thyroid disorders, Alzheimer’s, rheumatoid arthritis and obesity. Gluten is also thought to inhibit the absorption of essential nutrients and bind to minerals, making them unavailable for use. This is a problem considering that gluten is found in nearly every commonly eaten cereal grain available. <br><br><br>
Other common toxins which our liver has to contend with are alcohol, caffeine, cigarettes and drugs (both recreational and prescribed). Less common but still possible are heavy metals such as mercury, pesticides on vegetables (such as Round Up used on GMO crops) and even things such as Bisphenol A (found in plastic bottles, which is why a lot of them are claiming to be BPA free now, but can also be found in diet cool drinks and cash receipts you receive at the shop). <br><br><br>
So it goes without saying, the first step in supporting the functioning of your liver is to stop burdening it with:<br>
•	Sugar (all forms but most especially in the form of high fructose corn syrup)<br>
•	Additives and preservatives (that eliminates all forms of processed fast and convenience foods)<br>
•	Refined/industrial seed oils (sunflower oil, corn oil, grape seed oil etc.)<br>
•	Grains and cereals<br>
•	Trans fats (also known as hydrogenated vegetable oil)<br>
•	Caffeine (most likely only if having an excessive amount as moderate intake has been linked to beneficial effects)<br>
•	Alcohol <br><br><br>
What about foods that actually boost the detoxification functions? The family of enzymes I explained earlier need something called co-enzymes in order for them to function. Certain nutrients act as co-enzymes and through this mechanism manipulating the diet to include these nutrients can support the liver.<br><br><br>
One of the most important co-enzymes is something called glutathione. Glutathione is a powerful antioxidant and rids the liver of the nasty by-products of detoxification by making them water soluble.  Sulphur and magnesium are needed for the efficient functioning of glutathione. Foods rich in glutathione, sulphur and/or magnesium are:<br><br>
•	Cruciferous vegetables such as brussel sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage etc.<br>
•	Dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach and kale<br>
•	Tomatoes<br>
•	Garlic, onions and peppers<br>
•	Turmeric, cinnamon and cardamom<br>
•	Avocados<br>
•	Green tea<br>
•	Walnuts<br>
•	Cocoa and cacoa <br>
•	Grapefruits <br><br><br><br><br>
Another way to boost glutathione production is to exercise. Not only does it boost the glutathione levels, it also helps to rid the body of other toxins through sweating and deep breathing, and it boosts the immune system. <br><br><br>
What about supplementation?<br>
Supplementation, whether it is with glutathione or any other nutrients that support liver detox and health, is an option but I would reserve it for those who are already suffering the chronic side effects of poor liver health. <br><br><br>
Another concept that is gaining popularity is fasting for detox purposes. This is a tricky one. I am not sure there is any merit to a complete fast, but some believe it helps the liver to “re-boot”. However, for someone who is already in a nutrient-depleted state (that doesn't necessarily mean someone who is skinny, it could be someone eating a high fat, high sugar, micronutrient poor diet) fasting may not be the best idea.  For those who are chronically toxic, an elimination diet along with certain supplements, followed by a liver-supporting maintenance diet may be a more sensible approach than fasting. For everyone else, regular exercise, a daily diet that includes liver boosting foods and excludes foods that strain our liver is just what the doctor ordered!</div>
