<div><p>Possibly the most awkward part of my job is having to ask people about their toilet habits. Some people gladly furnish me with in-depth details and some people almost faint at my question. However, the regularity (as well as the consistency, colour and texture) of your bowel movements are a large part of gauging your gut and overall health. A lot of people don&rsquo;t think twice about the fact that they only go to the toilet every second or third day &ndash; for them that is normal. It is not. You should not move your bowels less than once a day, and theoretically we should move our bowels after each large meal, so perhaps more than once a day. It is OK to go less than this only if your stools remain small, light, soft in texture and fall into the 4 or 5 type on the Bristol Stool Chart. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you pass stools less frequently than once a day you may have what is referred to as latent constipation, which predisposes you to haemorrhoids and colorectal cancer. The following describes latent constipation:</p>
<ul>
<li>You pass stools less frequently than once a day</li>
<li>Your stools match types 1, 2, 3, 6 or 7 on the Bristol stool chart</li>
<li>You have to strain, even if only slightly, to complete a bowel movement</li>
<li>You have regular bloating, flatulence or abdominal cramps</li>
<li>You already suffer from haemorrhoids</li>
<li>You rely on laxatives, fibre supplements or laxogenic foods regularly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The good news is that you can normalise your bowel movements, and it is vital that you do so. Here are some tips on how to do so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find hidden food sensitivities, such as gluten, soy or lactose. It is not necessary to cut these out without first determining that you are actually intolerant.</li>
<li>Create a bathroom routine. It may sound silly, but each morning, sit quietly on the toilet for 10-20 minutes, even if you do not have a bowel movement. You are re-training your gut and your nervous system to relax at the same time.</li>
<li>Never ignore the urge to go, even if you are out in public. It may not be as comfy as your own home, but ignoring the urge to go makes constipation worse.</li>
<li>Consider a probiotic, but get advice on which is the right one. It needs to have sufficient amounts and the correct strain of bacteria.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Increase your digestive fire: veggies, nuts and seeds are good options. You may want to use a fibre supplement such as psyllium husk: start by adding &frac14; of a teaspoon to water and slowly work up to 2 teaspoons.</li>
<li>Incorporate fermented foods into your weekly nutrition. Foods like yogurt and kefir (if you do not have a dairy problem), kimchi, sauerkraut and kombucha add beneficial probiotics and enzymes.</li>
<li>Reconsider your meds: ask your doctor to revaluate any meds that could be compounding the problem.</li>
<li>Drink enough water during the day. Drinking a glass as you wake up can get things going.</li>
<li>Fat helps to stimulate intestinal motility. Avocado, avocado oil, olives and olive oil, coconut, coconut products and coconut oil, nuts, seeds and their butters, flax oil, fatty fish, fish oil and cod liver oil are all options.</li>
<li>Magnesium assists in relaxing the nervous system and the gut to relax. Magnesium is best absorbed through the skin, so a magnesium containing&nbsp;body spray or&nbsp;bathing in Epsom salts can increase your magnesium levels.</li>
<li>Decrease your stress levels: stress can make constipation worse, so make sure you include stress-relief techniques in your life, whether it is time to relax and read a book, meditation, exercise or whatever works for you.</li>
<li>Sleep for at least 6, preferably 8 hours a night. If you have any issues preventing you from proper and regular sleep, get it seen to ASAP.</li>
<li>Regular exercise helps bowel motility. Consider a mixture of weight training, and high intensity exercise such as sprints and plyometrics to help improve constipation and boost metabolism.</li>
</ol>
