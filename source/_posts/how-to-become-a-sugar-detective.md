Natural sugars are, well those naturally occurring in foods, such as fruit and dairy products. Added sugars are any sugars which have been added to a food product during the manufacturing process. <br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Why should I care about added sugars?</span><br><br>
We are getting way too much added sugars from our diets. All those empty calories contribute in some way to the development of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Plus, people who eat a lot of added sugars will naturally displace the fibre, vitamins and minerals that they should be eating, increasing their risks of osteoporosis and cancer among other things. <br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Why do food manufacturers add sugar to their products?</span><br><br>
Food manufacturers have been toying with us ever since the start of the low-fat craze. Since we were told that we must cut down fat as much as possible to protect our hearts, nearly every single product on the market became emblazoned with “low-fat” labels. It is a guaranteed sale. However, as soon as you remove fat from a food, it tastes worse. So what do the manufacturers do to make it taste good again? <br>
They add sugar to it. The product fly’s off the shelves because it is low fat, and so must be healthy right?<br><br>
Wrong. Ever since the start of the low-fat era, chronic disease such as diabetes and heart disease have sky-rocketed. In thinking that we were making the right choice by choosing low-fat foods, our intake of sugar has increased without us knowing it.<br><br>
You would be surprised at how many foods have hidden, added sugars in them. Despite a product displaying health messages such as “excellent source of iron”, “fat-free” or “25% less sugar”, it does not mean that it doesn’t contain a shocking amount of sugar. And it is not just obvious foods like chocolates and ice-creams; they are called “hidden sugars" for the reason of appearing in foods that you would lest expect them to: That low-fat yoghurt you ate for your mid-morning snack. That pasta sauce you used to cook dinner last night. That “whole-grain”, health-promising cereal that you bought for your child. That iced-tea you thought was a better choice than a Coke. <br><br>
Because food companies are not forced to put the total grams of added sugar on the food label, and they only have to list the sugars in the ingredients list, this has made it very easy to make a product look better than what it really is. Add the fact that sugar masquerades under a variety of disguises, and you have a very confused public.  Dextrose, sucrose, cane sugar, maltose are only a few of the names sugar is represented as in an ingredients list.<br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Ok, so how do I tell if a product has added sugar in?</span><br><br>
The best choice of foods are those that have no ingredient label at all, as those are whole and unprocessed foods (think fresh vegetables, chicken breasts, cheese etc.) However it is hard to buy only whole foods, and so you need to get into the habit of reading the food label and the ingredients list. <br><br>
Step 1: Look at that food label itself. Under carbohydrates, there should be a line for “of which sugar”. This indicates how many grams of sugar per 100 grams of that product, and how many grams per serving size. If a product contains less than 5 g per 100 grams as sugar, then it is considered low-sugar. If it contains more than 15 g per 100 g then it is considered high sugar and you should not choose that product.  <br><br>
Step 2: Find the ingredients list. Ingredients have to be listed in decreasing weight order, meaning that the first product on the ingredients list is the one that the food contains in the highest amount. By looking at the list, you should be able to identify any of the words used to describe sugar (see list later on). If any of these words are in the first 3 ingredients, put it back on the shelf. But be careful here: another sneaky trick played on us by the food companies is to spilt up the added sugars so that it comes from different sources. For example “cane sugar” may be listed second, “maltose” listed 4th, “fruit juice” listed 5th, and “corn syrup” listed 8th. At first glance this may not seem too bad, but that is a lot of sugar from a lot of different sources! Added sugars are added sugars, no matter what you call them. They all serve one purpose and that is to make a food sweeter (and us unhealthier).<br><br><span class="mySubHeading">The list of offenders - the many faces of sugar:</span><br><br>
So here is what you should look out for in the ingredients label:<br>
•	Agave nectar<br>
•	Brown sugar<br>
•	Can crystals<br>
•	Cane sugar<br>
•	Corn sweetener<br>
•	Corn syrup<br>
•	Crystalline fructose<br>
•	Dextrose<br>
•	Evaporated cane juice<br>
•	Fructose<br>
•	Fruit juice concentrates<br>
•	Glucose<br>
•	High-fructose corn syrup<br>
•	Hydrolysed starch<br>
•	Hone<br>
•	Invert sugar<br>
•	Lactose<br>
•	Maltose<br>
•	Malt syrup<br>
•	Molasses<br>
•	Raw sugar<br>
•	Sucrose<br>
•	Sugar<br>
•	Syrup<br><br>
This may seem tricky at first, but as you get used to it, it will get easier. Take charge of your health, because I can guarantee you that food companies are not doing it for you!</div>
