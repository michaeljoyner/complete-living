<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/holiday-christmas-food_1.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>The first thing to keep in mind is that balance is key (and no, by balance I do not mean 1 beer in each hand). By balance I mean that you don’t have to turn down everything someone offers you to eat or drink, nor should you use this time of year as an excuse to go buck-wild. Moderation (a dietician’s favourite word) is the answer. <br><br><br>
Use the following tips to keep yourself in check, while still enjoying the holiday season:<br><br><br>
1.	Pick your battles<br><br>
The Festive Season brings with it its own special treats that we don’t normally make or buy at any other time of the year. If you are faced with a lot of choice,pick what you really enjoy and don’t get to eat at other times, and enjoy that (in moderation, of course). For example, you can eat cheese and crackers any time, but Christmas cake generally only comes around at this time of year. <br><br>
2.	Be mindful of what you are eating<br><br>
It is very easy to keep scooping chips from a bowl that is sitting in front of you, even if you are not hungry. Food is bound to be around in abundance, don’t eat it just because it is there. Engage someone in conversation or do something else to keep your mind off it.<br><br>
3.	Plan ahead<br><br>
If you know you are going to a friend or family members house for a meal, make sure that your other meals and snacks throughout the day are balanced and healthy. A lot of people feel they have to starve themselves all day if they are going to have a big dinner – don’t do this. You can slow down your metabolism and you may overeat at dinner, causing discomfort. Rather eat sensibly throughout the day and have a normal portion at dinner.<br><br>
4.	Alternate water with your drink of choice<br><br>
Many people don’t realize how calorie-laden most alcoholic and soft beverages are, and so they don't take them into account. in reality, they can add a few hundred extra calories without you even knowing it (one glass of wine can have up to 100 calories or more in it, while a can of Coke has almost 150). Alcohol can make you hungry, causing you to eat more than you normally would. Drink water throughout the day, and if you do decide to have alcohol, alternate it with water. Your head will thank you the next day. Have sugar-free carbonated beverages and fruit juice in moderation.<br><br>
5.	Keep moving<br><br>
Don’t use the holidays as excuse to not have to exercise. Although it is not necessary to burn off every single extra calorie eaten during the holiday (you would need about an hour of intense exercise to burn off a chocolate), doing some sort of exercise will keep the waist-line creeping at bay. In addition, it will actually make you feel energised at a time it that it is very easy to feel sluggish and drained. Go for a walk or a bike ride along the beach front with the family, swim in the sea, or play a game of touch rugby in the garden. Maintaining some level of fitness will make getting back into the swing of things in January a bit easier. <br><br><br>
Wishing all the readers a wonderful Festive Season and Christmas, and looking forward to a healthful 2014!</div>
