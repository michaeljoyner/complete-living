Approx. 500g mince<br>
1 tin tomato &amp; onion mix<br>
1 onion<br>
1 small green pepper<br>
Chopped garlic – a teaspoon or two, depending on how strong you like it<br>
Couple of pinches of mixed herbs <br>
Approx. 1 cup of grated cheddar cheese (mature cheddar is nice if you have it on hand)<br>
2 aubergines<br>
2 potatoes (don't panic if you are counting the carbs - this dish makes 4 - 5 servings, and so you are essentially having half a potato per serving).<br><br><span class="underLine">Directions:</span><br><br>
1. Preheat oven to 180 degrees C.<br><br>
2. Slice the aubergine, sprinkle with salt and place on a paper towel, placing another paper towel on top. This draws out the excess water and also counteracts the bitterness. Leave to sit while you prepare the the potatoes.<br><br>
3. Halve the potatoes (leave the skin on for extra goodness) and boil them in salted water until they are cooked through but not falling apart (about half an hour)<br><br>
4. While the potatoes are boiling, fry the aubergine in oil (canola is best) - I find its best to use an electric frying pan with the lid on.  It takes about 10 min for the eggplant to be    soft – flip them over every now and then.<br><br>
5. While the potatoes are still boiling you can make your savoury mince.  You may have a favourite recipe – use it if you like – if not, here goes:<br><br>
Fry the chopped onion and green pepper in some oil or butter.   When soft, add the mince – use a fork to break it down nicely.  Let the mince fry with the onion and green pepper for about 10 minutes adding salt and black pepper, a dollop of mixed herbs and your chopped garlic (I like to buy jars of chopped garlic – so much easier!)<br>
When the mince looks cooked, add the tin of tomato &amp; onion and let the mixture simmer for about 5 minutes – taste and add more salt if necessary.<br><br>
6. By this time your potatoes should be ready and you aubergine should be out of the pan.  Slice the potatoes thickly.<br><br>
7. Now to layer the dish: put a layer of aubergine followed by a layer of potato in a casserole dish.  I like to salt the potatoes lightly.  Sprinkle half of the grated cheese over this.  Then spoon half the mince on top of the cheese.  Then add another layer of aubergine and potato followed by mince this time and then finish off with a topping of grated cheese.<br><br>
8. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes; when it looks yummy take it out!  Cool for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with a salad made with dark green leafy vegetables (such as baby spinach). <br><br>
ENJOY!</div>
