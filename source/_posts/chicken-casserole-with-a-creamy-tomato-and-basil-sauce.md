<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/creamy_chicken.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>You will need:<br><br>
- 8 pieces of chicken on the bone<br>
- Coconut oil for frying the chicken<br>
- salt and pepper<br>
- crushed garlic<br>
- 1 tablespoon of butter<br>
- 1 x onion, chopped<br>
- Half a punnet of mushrooms, chopped<br>
- 1 bell pepper, chopped<br>
- Tin of chopped tomatoes<br>
- 50 g tomato paste<br>
- 10 fresh basil leaves, chopped <br>
- 250 ml of cream<br>
- Dash of red wine<br><br>
Directions:<br><br>
1. Heat a pan with the coconut oil and add the chicken pieces, with salt, pepper and garlic.Cook for a few minutes, until chicken is browned.<br><br>
2. Place the chicken pieces in a casserole dish and leave to rest while you prepare the sauce.<br><br>
3. In a pot, melt the butter and brown the onions. Add the pepper and mushrooms and cook until softened.<br><br>
4. Add the tin of tomatoes, the tomato paste and the basil and stir through. Cook for a few minutes.<br><br>
5. Add the cream and wine and turn down heat and let the sauce simmer for a while until the sauce has thickened. If necessary thicken the sauce with just a little corn flour (very un-Banting I know but you just need a very little bit!)<br><br>
6. Pour the sauce over the chicken pieces in the casserole dish. <br><br>
7. Place the dish in the oven at a low heat of about 100 degrees Celsius and leave for 2 hours. For those Banting this dish can be eaten alone or with the low-carb bread recipe posted last week or with cauliflower mash.</div>
