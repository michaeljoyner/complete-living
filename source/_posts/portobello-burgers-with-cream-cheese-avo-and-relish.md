<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/portobello_burger.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>You will need:<br><br>
- 2 x portobello mushrooms per burger being made<br>
- 1 x good quality (preferably home-made) beef / pork patty per burger being made <br>

- 1 red onion, sliced into rings<br>

- Baby spinach leaves<br><br>
Directions:<br><br>
1. Carefully spread the cream cheese  on half of the mushrooms (approximately a teaspoon per mushroom). Place these mushrooms, plus the rest of the mushrooms without cream cheese, on a baking tray and place under the grill for a few minutes. <br><br>
2. In the meanwhile, cook your patty's in some olive or coconut oil and set aside.<br><br>
3. Remove the mushrooms from the grill and spread some relish and some avo on each one with the cream cheese. Season with sea salt and crushed black pepper.<br><br>
4. Place a patty on top of each decked-out mushroom, followed by the baby spinach leaves and tomato. Place the plain grilled mushrooms on top, like you would with the top half of a bread roll. Serve immediately.</div>
