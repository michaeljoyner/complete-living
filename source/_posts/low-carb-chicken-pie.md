<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/ClementineChicken_(1).jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>You will need:<br><br>
- 4 chicken breasts, cubed into small pieces<br>
- 1 onion, diced<br>
- 1 large bunch of spinach, stalks removed and chopped<br>
- 1 red pepper<br>
- Half a punnet of mushrooms<br>
- 2 teaspoons crushed garlic<br>
- salt, pepper and Italian herbs<br>
- 240 g tub of cream cheese<br>
- 250 ml grated cheese<br>
- 3 eggs<br>
- 1 tsp psyllium husk (optional) <br><br>
Directions:<br><br>
1. Fry the onion and garlic in some butter or coconut oil until softened. Add the spinach, pepper and mushroom and fry for a further few minutes.<br>
2. Add the chicken pieces to the vegetables and cook until the chicken has started to brown. If it is too watery let the water cook off for a few extra minutes or use the psyllium husk to thicken it. <br>
3. In a mixing bowl, beat the eggs and stir in the cream cheese. Add the seasoning.<br>
4. Place the chicken in a baking/pie dish and pour the egg mixture over.<br>
5. Sprinkle the grated cheese over the top and bake in a 180 degree oven for about 20 - 30 minutes or until the cheese is golden.<br>
