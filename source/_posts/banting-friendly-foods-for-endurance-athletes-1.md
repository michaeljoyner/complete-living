We are two Phat Girls who have embraced the Banting lifestyle with big fat enthusiasm. We have both been doing long distance running for over 10 years and have always followed the conventional sports nutrition guidelines of a high carbohydrate diet while training and on the road. We decided to start Banting just over 1 year ago and we have both experienced amazing results, improving our running times, body fat and performances. In the process we have been experimenting with what we can eat before a long run and while on the road, while sticking strictly to the Banting principles. From this experimentation, Phat Girls was born. The fact that one of us is a Registered Dietician has really helped in the development and analysis of our products. <br><br><span class="underLine">What products do we make?</span><br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Phat Bombs</span><br><br>
These kill two birds with one stone â€“ a breakfast bar (when kept in the freezer) and a gel (once in your fuel belt / bag). Phat Bombs are made from coconut oil, a rich source of rapidly-oxidised medium chain triglycerides for immediate energy, macadamia butter, dates, whey powder and macadamia butter. They are so divine you will be tempted by them even when not training or racing. These are available in full sized and bite sized, original and chocolate flavours.<br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Phat Cookies</span><br><br>
These are the perfect accompaniment to a cup of coffee before a race or training run, ride or paddle. Kids will love these too! These cookies have no preservatives or sugar, only real natural ingredients. For your convenience, they are available as ready baked cookies or as frozen dough so that you can bake them as and when you are ready for them.<br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Phat Rusks</span><br><br>
Finally, a Banting rusk that actually tastes like a rusk! These pack a mean punch in the calories department though, almost doubling that of a regular rusk. That makes them perfect for before a long distance training session.<br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Phat Shake</span><br><br>
Currently in a refreshing mango and mint flavour, this shake is great for before a session and is a divine cold recovery drink. This is also a fantastic lunch box option for an active child. <br><br><span class="underLine">How to order and contact us</span><br><br>
