Now, that is all changing: there is a lot of hub-bub in the nutrition world around the link between improper insulin signalling and the development of Alzheimer’s disease.<br><br><br>

Let me start off by briefly explaining what insulin does, its role on the development of diabetes and how it fits into the possible development of Alzheimer’s:<br>
Insulin is a hormone which is released by the pancreas in response to elevated blood sugar levels after a meal. It is important that the body maintains tight control of the level of sugar in the blood. After we eat and the sugar level of the blood increases, it is insulin’s job to lower this back down to normal levels by causing the liver, skeletal muscles and fat tissue to absorb the sugar. <br><br><br>
Type 2 diabetes starts off with the person suffering from insulin resistance, or pre-diabetes as it is sometimes referred to. This means that the body’s tissues have become resistant to the effects of insulin, and so the blood sugar is not being lowered as it should be after meals. The body tries to fix this problem by getting the pancreas to produce more insulin. The pancreas manages to keep up with the demand for a while, and blood sugar levels may only be slightly raised. Eventually the pancreas will not be able to keep up with the demand, blood sugar levels will rise above the normal thresh hold, and at that point, diabetes is diagnosed.<br><br><br>
So why are some referring to Alzheimer’s as diabetes type 3? What is the connection?<br><br>
Research is suggesting that impaired insulin signalling plays a role in the development of Alzheimer’s. Research in mice has shown us that drugs used for diabetic treatment reverses the Alzheimer’s-related dementia purposely given to the mice. Human studies have shown an improvement in memory in Alzheimer’s patients with previously-established insulin resistance when they were given drugs typically used to treat diabetes. Post-mortem studies have shown similar brain changes in those with Alzheimer’s and those with type 2 diabetes. <br><br><br>
All of this points to the suggestion that there is a link between the way the body makes and uses insulin and the development of Alzheimer’s disease. The exact mechanism still has to be determined – all we have now is a strong suspicion that insulin has some negative effect on the brain which over the long term can cause Alzheimer’s. <br><br><br>
As diabetes is an endocrine disorder, Alzheimer’s is a neuro-endocrine disorder that resembles yet is distinct from type 2 diabetes. Giving it the label of “type 3 diabetes” makes it sound as if it is a separate disease- not so. People with type 2 diabetes, and any other sort of impairment to how one’s insulin works, need to know that they may be at risk for the development of Alzheimer’s and need to take the necessary precautions.<br><br><br>
There are 2 ways to combat insulin resistance. One is to use medications, either to make the body more sensitive to the workings of insulin, or to provide the body directly with an exogenous source of insulin. This is typically how diabetics are treated. <br><br>
The second way is to limit carbohydrate intake. Without carbohydrates, the body does not need to use insulin to lower the blood sugar levels, as the blood sugar levels will not be raised as they would when eating carbohydrates. If your body does not need to release insulin, then you don’t need to worry about being insulin resistant, and so you don’t have to worry about insulin causing the brain cell damage needed to cause Alzheimer’s.<br><br><br>
Is this another reason to go low carb? Very likely. As always, I stress that a low carbohydrate diet has to be a well-formulated diet. It is easy to go wrong with it – important nutrients can be cut out which can lead to problems at a later stage. Please seek advice before attempting it.</div>
