Oopsie's are a bread-substitute, perfect for bread lovers trying to cut down on their carb intake. Versatile and easy to make, oopsies can be used for breakfasts, lunches and suppers. Use them as you would bread or rolls. One could even put pizza toppings on and grill!<br><br>
This recipe makes about 6 oopsie "rolls", but if you want you can put the mixture in a baking dish to make one large oopsie which can then be cut into pieces.<br><br>
You will need:<br><br>
3 large eggs<br>
100 g of cream cheese<br>
A pinch of baking powder.<br><br>
Directions:<br><br>
1. Separate the eggs (Here is a really easy way to separate eggs: crack an egg onto a dinner plate, being careful not to let the yolk break up. Then hold a disposable empty water bottle just above the yolk and squeeze the middle of the bottle, sucking the yolk into the bottle. Pour the yolk into a separate bowl. Repeat for the next 2 eggs).<br><br>
2. Add the baking powder to the egg whites and whip until stiff. This is much easier if you have an electric beater! Make sure the egg white is stiff enough to not move when you hold the bowl upside down.<br><br>
3. Mix the cream cheese into the egg yolks.<br><br>
4. Fold the egg white into the yolk, incorporating air.<br><br>
5. Dollop the mixture onto a greased/lined pan into 6 mounds.<br><br>
6. Bake at 150 degrees Celsius for about 30 minutes or until golden. Leave to cool slightly before using.<br><br>
If you are using the oopsie's for a savoury dish, add garlic or any other flavourings or herbs to the mixture. You could also used flavoured cream cheese.  If you are using for a sweeter dish, add cinnamon and a touch of artificial sweetener. <br><br>
Enjoy!</div>
