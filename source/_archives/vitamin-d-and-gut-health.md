<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/sunlight.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>Vitamin D is in fact not a vitamin, but rather acts more as a hormone. The word "vitamin" implies something that the body cannot synthesize and so needs to be obtained from the diet. The body synthesises vitamin D through the skin when it is exposed to sunlight.Vitamin D is found in food, but in tiny quantities and so you would have to consume a lot of the sources to get the amount of Vitamin D your body needs.  <br><br><br>
We have known about the role of vitamin D in the absorption of calcium and its related role in bone health for many, many years. However, there seems to be a lot more to this humble “vitamin” than we have ever thought: in the last 50 years or so, a lot of research has been put into the link between a Vitamin D deficiency and diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes and gut-related conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and colon cancer.<br><br><br>
Your gut is home to trillions of different types of bacteria - so many so that we are in fact more bacteria than we are human. We have a mutually beneficial relationship with these bacteria – we provide the environment they thrive in and they help us to digest food and produce certain compounds for us.<br><br><br>
The health of our gut underpins many conditions. This is because the gut is the first line of defense to the outside world – it is a major area for exposure to pathogens and toxic particles. If your gut is not in peak condition to block the entry of these pathogens and toxic particles then you run the risk of them entering into your body. The gut is also where nutrient absorption and uptake happens, and so again, if your gut is not healthy then your nutrient levels may be inadequate. <br>
Several factors can lead to your gut not being in peak condition – certain foods may cause your gut to becoming permeable or “holey”, allowing the toxins and pathogens to move through; an imbalance of the gut bacteria can create an sub-optimal environment for nutrient absorption and uptake, and now it is apparent a lack of Vitamin D receptors in the gut can also affect the condition of it.<br><br><br>
Current recommendations are for adults to have around 600 - 800 International Units of Vitamin D per day. However, the thinking is now that this recommendation is way too low, and that Vitamin D deficiency is a lot more common than originally thought. Most South Africans are likely to be under the impression that they get sufficient Vitamin D thanks to our great weather; however this may not be so. Many of us spend most of our time indoors, and the increased awareness of skin cancer means people get too little sun exposure. Even if you are lucky enough to spend at least 20 minutes in direct sunlight every day (with good skin exposure) you still may not be getting the amount your body, and specifically your gut, needs. <br><br><br>
So how does Vitamin D link to our gut health? We know that Vitamin D deficiency is a recognized factor in the development of inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer. But why is this?<br><br>
It seems that it has to do with the amount of Vitamin D receptors in our gut, and the effect that the bacteria we have living in our gut have on those receptors.  The amount and type of the bacteria we have in our gut is vital to many aspects of our health - it has been found that certain bacteria create metabolic signals which effect inflammatory responses and cell growth.<br><br>
A study published recently in the American Journal of Pathology investigated this relationship between Vitamin D and gut bacteria. They looked at 3 groups of mice: the first group of mice were normal, the second had had their vitamin D receptors in the gut removed and the third had their guts altered to be completely free of any bacteria. The mice were then all given a harmless bacteria strain and a harmful one, and their reactions were noted. It was found that the mice that had had their vitamin D receptors removed were much more susceptible to the harmful bacteria and developing infection. The researchers observed that the vitamin D receptor bound to an inflammatory molecule developed by the harmful bacteria and removed it, thereby reducing inflammation (and therefore damage) in the gut. <br>
This relationship between Vitamin D and the gut could be really significant for people who suffer from gut problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease and those who are at increased risk of colon cancer.<br><br><br>
So what is the best way to ensure you are getting enough Vitamin D? I already mentioned that there are some food sources of it, but these foods contain quite low levels of Vitamin D. Irrespective, it is important to regularly include these dark oily fish in your diet for their other health benefits: cod liver oil, salmon, mackerel, pilchards and sardines. Certain foods such as milk and eggs may be fortified with Vitamin D depending on the brand.<br><br><br>
Exposure to sunlight is the most efficient way to get enough Vitamin D. Our skin is designed to make Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight. What with the increased awareness of skin cancer, and our sedentary lifestyles, many people do not spend enough time in the sun to get the Vitamin D they need. It’s good to know that you do not have to be in the sun until you are burnt, as your body can make up to 25 000 IU of Vitamin D in less than the time it will take you to burn. Obviously, the amount of Vitamin D made and the rate at which you get sun burnt depend son how strong the sun is at the time of day, how far you live away from the equator and how fair or dark your skin is (people with darker skin take more time to make Vitamin D and to burn). A good rule of thumb is to try and get 20 minutes of sun exposure per day, when the sun is at it’s strongest (between 10 am and 2 pm ), with as much skin exposure as possible. Large areas of your skin, such as your back, will be more efficient at producing Vitamin D than small areas such as your face and hands. Another benefit of taking some time out to sit in the sun each day is that it increases the level of our happy hormone, serotonin, this will help improve your mood and your sleep at night. Your parents were right when they kept nagging you to go play outside!<br><br>
Although getting nutrients from food is always better than from supplements, if you have a serious deficiency in Vitamin D, short-term high dose supplementation may be very beneficial. The first step is to get your levels tested and then speak to your health care practitioner about your supplementation options.</div>
