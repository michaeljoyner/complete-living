<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/hfcs_final.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p><span class="mySubHeading">What is High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) ?</span><br><br>
As the name suggests, HFCS originally comes from corn (also known as maize), one of the most extensively cultivated crops on earth. HFCS was first created in the 1960's and ever since has been widely used worldwide as a food preservative and sweetener. <br><br><br>
In order to make HFCS, the corn undergoes several processes. It is first concentrated into cornstarch. It is then treated with hydrochloric acid and enzymes. These enzymes convert some of the glucose making up the syrup into fructose. This makes the syrup sweeter – the higher the concentration of fructose the sweeter the syrup. Manufacturers can use different HFCS’s depending on the sweetness they require – for example HCFS 55 (mainly used in soft drinks) is 55 % fructose and 42 % glucose while HFCS 42 (used in baked goods such as bread) is 42 % fructose and 53% glucose. <br><br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Why is HFCS so abundant in foods and beverages?</span><br><br>
One may question why it is necessary to go through the long process of chemically altering corn when there are other foods that can be used to sweeten foods, such as cane sugar, honey or molasses. Well, again it all comes down to economics and money, and unfortunately our health takes a backseat.<br><br><br>
As mentioned earlier, maize is one of the most abundant crops on the earth, and so it is more “economically feasible” (for whom I wonder – surely not for those with mounting health care costs due to diabetes and heart disease?) to use it as a sweetener. Other crops such as sugar cane are not as high-yielding. This leads to maize production getting subsidised and HFCS becoming the most widely used sweetener around. In addition, it costs about three times less to make HFCS than other sweeteners, which is why HFCS is found in so many products. <br><br><br>
The Corn Refiners Association (CRA), an American based organisation is desperately trying to convince the public that there is nothing wrong with HFCS. Of course they are, HFCS is their bread and butter, so to speak. In 2008, the CRA launched a public relations campaign called “Changing the conversation about High Fructose Corn Syrup”. This was an attempt to bring redemption to the name of HFCS after it began to be linked to obesity and disease. This shocking campaign reeks of economic greed and a total disregard for public health. It can be equated to when, in the 1960’s, cigarette companies tried to sway the publics’ view on the dangers of cigarettes by discrediting the science backing it up. Just like with the CRA and HFCS, the cigarette companies’ ultimate goal was to prevent people from giving up something that will cause them to lose money.  <br><br><span class="mySubHeading">So why is HFCS so bad?</span><br><br><br>
First off, any food or beverage product that contains HFCS is automatically going to be a highly processed food. By nature, these foods contain a variety of unhealthy ingredients, and in some cases, an excess of calories. Just by cutting out HFCS, you are cutting out these other additives and excess calories, and already doing your body a favour.<br><br><br>
In addition, there is also a link between ill health and excess fructose consumption. Note that the emphasis here is on excess fructose consumption. Fructose naturally found in fruit, and so when fruit is eaten within normal proportions, ones fructose intake will not be of concern. Unfortunately, most people don’t get their intake of fructose from fresh fruit alone, bit instead from added sweeteners such as HFCS. <br><br><br>
Before the development of the sugar industry, man had a low intake of fructose from a limited range of fruits. Other food making up the diet was milk, meat and vegetables, all of which have no fructose. Since sugar has become a mass produced additive, fructose consumption has sharply increased. <br><br><br>
Sucrose (or sugar) is made up of the two molecules fructose and glucose. Glucose is the primary and essential fuel for all cells throughout the body. Glucose levels are kept in check by insulin, and glucose is either transported into the cells for immediate use or stored in the liver as glycogen for later use. On the other hand, the body has no need for dietary fructose; it cannot be used by any of your body’s cells. It is poorly absorbed by the gut and is mostly cleared out of the body by the liver. The more fructose ingested, the more pressure your liver is under.  Because the body has no biological use for it, the fructose is converted into fat, which can cause non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. If the liver is not working properly, it is likely that its close neighbour, the pancreas, will not work as it should either. If the pancreas is not working properly, this compromises insulin production which in turn leads to diabetes. <br><br><br>
That is not all. Although the CRA will consistently deny it, fructose intake has been linked to abnormal blood lipid (or fat) levels, and subsequent development of chronic disease. In one study, fructose intake was examined in relation to weight, blood lipid levels and LDL particle size. You may recall from my previous articles that LDL is often referred to as the “bad cholesterol”. In fact is actually the size, and not the amount, of the LDL particle size that one needs to worry about – the small LDL particles are atherogenic (or artery-clogging), whilst the large LDL are not. Back to the study, fructose intake was associated with a higher level of the small LDL particles. This suggests that the intake of fructose increases the risk of heart disease by increasing the amount of small LDL particles. Other studies in humans as well as animals have also suggested that the intake of fructose is linked to high blood lipid levels. <br><br><br>
Finally, albeit in rats, it has been observed that excess fructose may have an negative effect on leptin. Leptin is our appetite regulating hormone, and if this is not working as it should, we will automatically eat more. It goes without saying that excessive eating leads to excessive weight gain and ultimately disease. <br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Which foods contain HFCS?</span><br><br><br>
You can probably guess common food sources of HFCS – things like carbonated and artificial fruit beverages, kids cereals (for example Fruit Loops), sweets, ready-made desserts and confectionery. If you try to cut out these processed “junk foods” (and drinks) chances are that you will automatically be cutting down on your HFCS intake. <br><br><br>
But you may be surprised about where else HFCS lurks, in foods you would least expect it. This is because these foods are marketed to us as being healthy or low fat. Low fat they may be, but what’s the point in eating something low fat when it is packed to the brim with over-processed chemical sweetener?!<br><br><br>
Common culprits are salad dressings (especially the “lite” varieties), adult breakfast cereals and bars (yes, even the ones which claim to be super healthy and packed with fibre!), tomato and other sauces, some breads (even those posing as "health" breads!) and sweetened fruit yoghurts.  <br><br>
Do your health a favour - learn which foods contain HFCS and make sure you and your family avoid them. I have said it before: stick to the outer aisles of the supermarket. Here you will find whole, unprocessed foods such as fresh vegetables and fruit, dairy products and meats. Venture into the inner aisles and here you will find foods trying desperately to pose as healthy options, which are in fact killing us.</div>
