Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body. 99% of it is found in the bones and teeth, where it plays a structural role. Up until the age of about 30 years, bone formation is faster than bone loss. Because of this, up until the age of 30 is the most critical time to be taking in enough calcium in order to build up enough stores for when bone loss overtakes bone formation. Of course, beyond the age of 30 years bone formation does still take place, albeit at a slower rate, and so calcium remains an essential component of the diet.<br><br>
Calcium is also found in the blood and surrounding fluids. The calcium in the bones serves as a reserve pool; supplementing the calcium found in the blood should it become low. This is because the blood calcium has extremely important roles to play, including maintenance of normal blood pressure and blood clotting. The body has a very smart way of making sure that the amount of calcium in the blood is always within normal levels: If you are not eating enough calcium-rich foods, the level of calcium in the blood drops. Calcium is then drawn from the bones to replenish these blood levels. This is the body’s way of maintaining the proper functioning of the heart and blood vessels. Unfortunately, every time the calcium is drawn from the bones, they become weaker. This can happen in men and women, who for whatever reason do not take in enough calcium (often in women it is to maintain a slim figure).<br><br>
Aside from the above-mentioned functions, research (although still in the early stages) has also found links between calcium intake and the prevention of high cholesterol, diabetes and cancer. Links between calcium intake and maintaining a healthy body weight have also been identified. It’s easy to see that the intake of calcium as part of a balanced diet is really important. <br><br><span class="underLine">What is osteoporosis?</span><br><br>
Osteoporosis is the loss of bone mineral density. This causes the bones to become very weak, and eventually even light bumps or falls can cause fractures and breaks. There are 2 main types of osteoporosis. The first is <span class="underLine">oestrogen-androgen deficient osteoporosis</span>.  This type of osteoporosis effects women, as it involves the hormone oestrogen. When levels of oestrogen are low, this causes an accelerated loss of bone mass. There are 2 main reasons why women can have low oestrogen levels: The first is menopause. During menopause oestrogen levels drop significantly. This accelerates bone loss for up to 6 to 8 years following menopause.   The second reason is extreme restriction of the diet. This causes a very low body weight, which in turn causes the ovaries to produce very low levels of oestrogen.  Again, low levels of oestrogen cause bone loss to accelerate drastically. This is common in young women with disordered eating patterns, and these women can suffer from osteoporosis many years after regaining a normal lifestyle and weight. <br><br>
The second type of osteoporosis is called age-related osteoporosis. This type can affect both men and women, and it normally occurs beyond the age of 70 years old. <br><br><br><span class="underLine">What is the best way to make sure you are getting enough calcium: food or supplements?</span><br><br>
These days there is a pill for everything. Of course, in many cases they are life-saving and there is no question about whether or not to use them, such as in the case of antibiotics. However, when it comes to the prevention of conditions, there is very rarely a pill that can trump a balanced diet. The best example of this may be calcium. <br><br>
Calcium supplements have been under the microscope lately, with a lot of conflicting studies coming out. Some have found links between calcium supplements and heart attacks and death from heart conditions, while other have found no such relationship. In my opinion, it is better to avoid something until it all the risks and benefits have been made very clear by science, especially when it is a preventative measure which can be achieved in another way, in this case the diet.<br><br>
One of the theories is that, unlike calcium from the diet which provides the body with a sustained, low level of calcium over a long period of time, supplements provide it in a bolus form (a lot at once), which can cause deposits of calcium in the blood vessels, increasing the chances of heart disease.<br><br>
Besides actual calcium supplement pills, a lot of foods are enriched with calcium and so you may be taking in a lot of supplemental calcium already, without even knowing it, potentially increasing your risk of heart conditions. Multivitamins often have a high level of calcium in as well.<br><br><br><span class="underLine">What is the best way to ensure that you are getting enough calcium from your diet?</span><br><br>
Fortunately for non-diary lovers and vegans/vegetarians, calcium is found in a lot more foods than just milk, cheese and yoghurt. Some examples are dark green vegetables, soy beans, almonds, tofu and fortified foods.<br><br>
Of course, the absorption of calcium relies on Vitamin D. Living in sunny South Africa should ensure that most of us have adequate levels of Vitamin D (your body can make it from sunlight). Vitamin D is also found in certain fortified foods, such as margarines and bread. <br><br>
A nutrition assessment will determine whether your intake of calcium and Vitamin D is normal. If not I will be able to advise you on how to improve it.<br><br>
