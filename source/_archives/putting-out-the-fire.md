<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/inflammation.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>When you stub your toe, it swells up and is very sore for a short period of time. This is acute inflammation, and is a vital process of healing. When controlled, inflammation is very important as it is the reason our body is able to fight off viruses, bacteria and other unwanted invaders.<br><br>
The problems begin when the body is in a chronic state of inflammation. Chronic inflammation occurs when the body no longer has the ability to turn off the acute inflammatory response, and the inflammation becomes like a continuously-burning fire in the body. This condition of chronic inflammation does not cause pain; it is something going on in the background scenes of your daily life, and may not be something you are acutely aware of. You may however feel constantly tired - you battle to understand how people get to the gym or go for a run when all you want to do is lie down and nap. You may suffer from symptoms or “niggles” that you only realise are linked to the inflammation after you have addressed it; these could be skin problems, irritable bowel syndrome, allergies, ongoing joint or muscle pain, asthma, high blood pressure or raised blood sugar levels.<br><br><span class="underLine">The link between inflammation, cholesterol, heart disease and stroke:</span><br><br>
Most people assume that cholesterol is directly responsible for heart disease or heart attacks, as it “clogs up the blood vessels”. This is not entirely accurate, as it is inflammation that gets the whole “clogging up” progress started. Here is how, in very simple terms:<br><br>
Chronic inflammation damages blood vessels, which signals to the immune system that immune cells need to be sent to the blood vessel to help it heal. Once the cells have done that, cholesterol is laid over that particular patch, almost like a plaster. However, the problem of the inflammation has not been addressed and so the process continues. The cholesterol plaster begins to bulge and eventually breaks off. The body reacts to this by forming a clot to heal the damage. This clot, if broken off from the blood vessel wall, can travel to the heart (causing a heart attack) or the brain causing a stroke).  So you can see from this scenario that cholesterol is in fact not the direct cause of heart disease or stroke, it is inflammation that begins the whole process. <br><br><span class="underLine">The link between inflammation, type 2 diabetes and obesity:</span><br><br>
The link between obesity and diabetes is well-established – in fact the term “diabesity” was coined to explain the relationship. It is thought that inflammation may actually precede the development of diabesity. Possible reasons for this include inflammatory cytokines cause cells to become insulin resistant, which leads to diabetes and weight gain, and that inflammation in the brain may cause leptin resistance. Leptin is the hormone that controls our appetite and so when our brain becomes resistant to leptin, we are unable to regulate our appetite and our metabolism becomes impaired.<br><br><span class="underLine">How is chronic inflammation caused?</span><br><br>
Unfortunately, our modern lifestyles are a major cause of the levels of chronic inflammation that we are seeing. Stress is a huge contributor – we live such a fast-paced life and most of us put immense pressure on ourselves. We work long hours and this leaves little time for relaxation and unwinding. Lack of regular and good quality sleep is also a huge problem – all adults need at least 6 hours of (preferably uninterrupted) sleep every night for the immune system to repair itself. We breathe in a lot of pollution, especially those living in built up cities. We ingest a lot of chemicals in our foods, this can be in take-away and processed foods, or even pesticides sprayed onto the fruit and vegetables you are buying. These chemicals we breathe in and eat are identified as foreign invaders by the immune system, causing it to create inflammation. Our guts are not in the state they should be in – the good bacteria and bad bacteria levels are unbalanced. Pair this with a diet which does not support gut health (refined foods, a lot of gluten and sugar etc.), a lack of Vitamin D (we don’t get as much sunshine as we should be) and you have chronic gut inflammation.<br><br><span class="underLine">How to reduce and eliminate chronic inflammation:</span><br><br>
•	Get your diet right:  this is perhaps the most important step. Seek advice on how to sustainably follow a good quality, anti-inflammatory diet. This means avoiding inflammatory foods (refined seed oils, gluten, sugar, refined carbohydrates, trans fats, meat and dairy containing hormones) and including anti-inflammatory foods (omega 3 fatty acids, good quality fats, antioxidants, phytonutrients, fermented foods).<br><br><br>
•	Decrease your stress levels! This is probably the most difficult, but one of the most important steps. Many people underestimate the influence that stress has on our physical health. Stress comes in many, many forms. Most commonly known is emotional stress – relationships, work etc. Stress chemistry is also initiated by putting pressure on yourself to not eat this, eat that, exercise this many times a week. You may be doing all these things in the hope of losing weight but find you are not – this is the power of stress-induced inflammation.  It is very important to sometimes take a step back and look at the bigger picture. Take time out. Practice mindfulness. Relax. Breathe.  Enjoy life. <br><br><br>
•	Fix your sleep cycle: If you have bad sleeping habits, put this to bed right now. Get into a routine which supports good quality sleep – avoid brain stimulating activities (TV, computer work etc.) at least 2 hours before bed, rather do something relaxing like have a hot bath or read a book. Get into bed at a reasonable time, even if you don’t fall asleep immediately – it is all about training your body. Make sure your alarm is set for minimum 6 hours ahead. You may need several weeks to get your body into the habit, but persevere.<br><br><br>
•	Supplement use: seek advice on this before attempting it. Certain supplements such as Curcumin can markedly reduce inflammation.</div>
