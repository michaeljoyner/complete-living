<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/mindless_snacking.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>Its 3:30 pm and you have a project due at 4 pm. You are stuck. Rather than brainstorming it, you storm through a bag of chips, hoping you will find the answer at the bottom of it.<br><br><br>
Everyone does it – snacking is the archetypal distraction. The catch is that it is rarely done out of hunger and so it leads to weight gain. To make matters worse, this type of snacking usually involves all of the wrong foods – foods we consider comforting such as sweets, chocolate, chips, biscuits and other carb, sugar and trans fat-rich foods. <br><br><br>
Mindless snackers don’t snack because they are hungry - they snack because they are bored, stressed out, tired or depressed. Because they are snacking on the wrong type of foods, they perpetuate their problem by causing a sharp increase in blood sugar levels, shortly followed by a plummet, which makes them hungry again. This can send the persons mood on a rollercoaster ride, making their stress levels worse. And so they reach for a snack, and the cycle continues.<br><br>
If you know this is your problem, try to keep a food diary for a few days. Make 3 columns in your diary: the time of day, what you are eating and your current mood (and the reason for that mood) at the time of eating. I do this with some of my patients, and it really helps us to identify the time of day or the mood that the patient is in when snack attack occurs. For example, you may find that it is in normally in the late afternoons that you find yourself halfway through a chocolate that you don’t remember opening. This may be because your lunch was not sufficiently nutritious to keep you sustained through the afternoon, or it may be because by this time you are feeling super stressed out by work.<br><br><br>
Once you have identified what causes you to mindlessly snack, you need to sort it out. Whether it is a stressful job, boredom or tiredness, food (and especially the types of common snacks explained above) is not going to solve them. Take note of the following tips to prevent your next snack attack:<br><br><br><span class="underLine">Get your zzzzzzzzz's in:</span><br><br>
Easier said than done sometimes but do your best to prioritise 6 – 8 hours of sleep every night. Irregular or too little sleep can affect the appetite-controlling hormones, ghrelin and leptin. One study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that subjects ate 500 calories more when they slept for 4 hours as opposed to 8 hours. 500 extra calories on an isolated day won’t affect you but 500 extra calories every day eventually will.  Fatigued people are also more likely to snack on sugary foods or drinks to perk them up.<br><br><span class="underLine">Work that body:</span><br><br>
Yes, yes you have heard it before – exercise helps prevent stress. Then what is stopping you? There is no doubt that exercise is one of the best stress-busters around. Instead of plonking on the couch with that bag of popcorn after a long day at the office, take Fido for a walk in the park, put on some beats and dance, pound the pavement or tick off some laps in the pool.

If you are eating properly, this should help to curb mindless snacking as you shouldn’t feel those dreaded “sugar-lows”. Making sure you have a source of protein at each meal, along with plenty of veg and healthy fats should keep your blood sugar levels stable throughout the day, keeping you full and energized. Avoid take-aways, junk foods and sugar-laden drinks. <br><br><span class="underLine">Beat boredom:</span><br><br>
Whether it is at home or on a slow day at work, boredom is one of the most common reasons for mindless snacking. If you find yourself constantly opening the fridge or kitchen cupboard, hoping each time that there will be something new in there, you are probably bored. Break the cycle by going for a walk, calling a friend or reading a book. Don’t turn on the TV- it is a common cause of snacking amnesia!<br><br><span class="underLine">Breathe deeply:</span><br><br>
For those who are stress-eaters, a simple bit of mindful breathing helps. Close your eyes and take some deep breaths. Even kick off your shoes and do some simple yoga stretches in your office. You will feel calmer, more zen and ready to face that project head on.<br><br><span class="underLine">Get fresh:</span><br><br>
It is often after dinner, in front of the TV that the sugar or salt craving hits. Whether it is chocolate or chips that are your weaknesses, whatever you put in your mouth now are empty calories that are not helping your get-into-shape efforts. Go brush your teeth or chomp on some fresh minty gum – you will soon forget your craving.</div>
