<div>This weekend I was lucky enough to attend a functional medicine workshop. For those of you who are not aware of what functional medicine is, here is the definition from the Institute of Functional Medicine website <a href="http://www.functionalmedicine.org">www.functionalmedicine.org</a><br><br><br>
“Functional medicine addresses the underlying causes of disease, using a system-orientated approach and engaging both patient and practioner in a therapeutic relationship. It is an evolution in the practice of medicine that better addresses the healthcare needs of the 21st century. By shifting the traditional disease-centred focus of medical practice to a more patient-centred approach, functional medicine addresses the whole person, not just an isolated set of symptoms. Functional medicine practioners spend time with their patients, listening to their histories, and looking at interactions among genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors that that can influence long-term health and complex, chronic disease. In this way, functional medicine supports the unique expression of health and vitality for each individual”.  <br><br><div class="art_pic_wrapper">

</div>
<br><br><br>
The workshop was run by Doctors Kara Fitzgerald and Kristi Hughes, both highly experienced functional medicine practioners from the US. <br><br>
Functional medicine echoes what I have heard Professor Tim Noakes say before in the past: that eventually there will be no need for chronic medicine. Yes, we will always need doctors to sew us up when we get injured, or to re-set our arm if we break it – in other word in acute medical situations. But if we practice the foundations of functional medicine we can reverse, prevent and eventually eradicate chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, gastrointestinal problems, arthritis and more.  <br><br>
Functional medicine uses nutrition and diet as a basis, and then uses what are referred to medical foods and nutraceuticals to support and treat chronic conditions. These products are well-researched by functional medicine bodies but do not have the power of the pharmaceutical industry behind them, which is why you probably have never heard of them. However, functional medicine and the use of these medical foods is spreading and is used with great success in many countries. <br><br>
Kristi Hughes mentioned to us that in the US the average amount of time that a general practioner will spend with his or her patient is about 7 minutes. I suspect that South Africa is not far off. As you read in the definition above functional medicine does not take a disease-centred approach, but rather a patient-centred approach. This involves spending time with the patient, talking to them and using a time line to identify what events throughout their life caused their body to be displaying the symptoms it is now. Family history is taken to identify what the patient is at risk for. With the patients help, triggering events of the disease are placed along the time line to identify when the body began to display symptoms. Finally mediators of the disease are identified - these are habits or environmental factors that perpetuate the disease condition. This may sound complicated, so let me give you an example set out in 2 different scenarios: one in a traditional western medicine situation, and one in a functional medicine setting:<br><br><br>
Traditional western medicine:<br>
A 50 year old male’s father dies of a heart attack and so he decides to go to the doctor to check his health and see what risk he has of suffering the same fate. The doctor sends him for blood tests and finds that his cholesterol is elevated (his total and LDL – or the “bad” cholesterol). The doctor gives him a statin (a common type of medication used to treat those at risk for or with heart disease) and sends him on his way, with a follow up appointment for 3 months time made.<br><br><br>
Functional medicine approach:<br>
Another man in the same situation decides to go to a functional medicine practioner to see what advice he can get in reducing his risk of heart disease. To his surprise the practioner sits down with him and develops a time line of his life, from birth right through to the present day, going through any significant events (environmental or health related) in his life. These are things such as whether he ever had any stressors in his life, like the loss of a loved one, job changes, birth of children or any previous medical conditions such as gut conditions. The practioner described his life events back to him, and what came to light was that at the age of 40, after changing jobs, he had become less active and had begun to gain weight around his stomach area. Since then he had also begun to feel very fatigued later in the day and had to drink coffee to keep himself going. He also began to suffer from joint stiffness in the mornings and to lose muscle tone throughout his body. In addition to this information, the practioner also took down a detailed diet history from him.<br><br><br>
The practioner explained to him that what she suspected was happening was that when he changed jobs, he had begun to be more sedentary due to the nature of his new job. Because he didn’t adjust his eating habits, he had begun to put on weight. This caused him to become insulin resistant, which caused his body to produce excess insulin. This increased the amount of inflammation through his body, causing the joint stiffness. Due to the relationship between insulin and testosterone he also began to lose muscle tone. <br><br><br>
The practioner went on to tell him that she would need to send him for blood tests to confirm her suspicions. These were not be the standard tests a GP would send him for, instead she would also test  for inflammatory markers and insulin levels. She informed him that would also need to measure his body composition. <br><br><br>
The blood results confirmed her suspicions. Not only was his cholesterol and LDL elevated, his LDL level was largely made up of the dangerous small, dense LDL particles. If he had his LDL tested through a GP, even if his LDL was raised but they were the large un-harmful LDL particles the chances that he would still be put on a statin (unnecessarily) are high. The blood tests also showed that he had high levels of triglycerides, inflammation and his insulin levels were raised.<br>
When the practioner did the body composition analysis, she found that his waist to hip ratio was high, another  risk factor for heart disease. Not only that, but she picked up a high level of abdominal fat.<br><br><br>
From his diet history, she found that he was eating a lot of carbohydrates, most likely what was causing his high triglyceride and insulin levels. <br><br>
After discussing all of this with the patient he was able to understand how his lifestyle  and his environment was impacting his health. Over the next visits the practioner helped him with an appropriate diet, prescribed him appropriate medical foods and nutraceuticals and advised him on an exercise programme. This helped to sort out his underlying inflammation and  insulin levels and he now has a normal blood lipid profile. He has increased energy levels, doesn’t suffer from fatigue or joint stiffness and feels better than he has in years. All that without any medication needed!<br><br><br>
What is so interesting about functional medicine is that it integrates all the health care professionals. At the workshop there were homeopaths, chiropractors, medical doctors, Chinese medicine experts and dieticians, amongst other professionals, all learning the same thing. Perhaps eventually there will be no need for separate specialists working in isolation, rather just functional medicine practioners all working together toward the same goal: overall health.</div>
