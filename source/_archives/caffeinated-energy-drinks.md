<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/energy_drinks.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>I have seen this scenario a few times while standing in the queue in a convenience store in the early morning, and it always shocks and surprises me a bit: a parent, obviously on the school-run, buying their child some last minute lunch, which often includes a caffeinated energy drink, such as a Red Bull or Monster. <br><br><br>
These energy drinks have become increasingly popular and every day there is a new brand or variety on the shelf. They promise endless energy, revitalisation, improved performance, concentration and speed. Sounds great, right? What parent wouldn't want their kid to have all these attributes in class or on the sports field?<br><br><br>
There is more to it than just the drink. Entire brands have been built, including clothing and other paraphernalia, and athletes are sponsored by the companies. Not boring, hum-drum athletes like golfers or snooker players, but super-cool athletes like motor-cross riders and surfers. For a child with big dreams, drinking the energy drinks is a no-brainer if it has got any chance of making him like the guy flipping his bike in the air. <br><br><br>
But parents beware: you could be doing your child more harm than good. In fact, if you regularly imbibe in these magical brews yourself you may just be doing yourself harm.<br><br><br>
Not so long ago there was a story in the New York Daily News about a 33 year old man who had died while playing basketball, just after consuming a caffeinated energy drink. The cause of his death? Dilated cardiomyopathy. In other words, his heart stopped. <br>
This is by no means the only story like this. If you look for them, there are a significant amount of cases of death related to the consumption of energy drinks.<br><br><br>
When it comes to children, one of the main issues may be that sports drinks and energy drinks are often confused for one another. Buying your child an energy drink for training or a match is not appropriate whereas a sports drink can be (depending on the type and duration of the sport). Sports drinks (such as Energade, Powerade or Game) are designed to replace electrolytes lost in sweat during prolonged exercise and to provide energy in the form of carbohydrates. Energy drinks typically contain stimulants such as caffeine, guarana and taurine, with varying amounts of carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. They have no electrolytes in and so if they are being used while exercising, dehydration is a risk. A recent report from the American Academy of Paediatrics stated that these energy drinks have no place in the diet or a child or teenager, no matter how active they are.<br><br><br>
The magic ingredient in energy drinks promising the increased energy, vitality, performance and concentration is, of course, caffeine. Although limited use of caffeine in adults can have positive effects (and even then it is extremely variable and dose dependent), the use of caffeine in children and adolescents has NOT been thoroughly researched, and may be dangerous and even fatal.<br><br><br>
The tolerance for caffeine varies among individuals and generally, healthy adults can tolerate caffeine in moderation. However, children and adolescents will be more acutely affected by the side effects of caffeine than an adult. Side effects of excess caffeine are a raised blood pressure, seizures, increased heart rate, an irregular heartbeat, sleep disturbances, stroke and increased anxiety. Children with preexisting liver, kidney or heart conditions, diabetes or mood and behavioural disorders may be at higher risk for the these negative consequences.  Combine these  with the stress of increased exertion or exercise on the body (such as when your child is playing sport) and a heart attack is not far-fetched. <br><br><br>
The caffeine content of energy drinks varies depending on the brand. Often these drinks contain caffeine as well as something called guarana. Gaurana is a plant extract that contains caffeine, with one gram being equal to 40 to 80 mg of caffeine. Gaurana is marketed as an energy booster and as a weight loss stimulant. Currently, manufacturers are not required to state any other sources of caffeine on the can, and so the entire dose can be more than what is listed. The total caffeine content of one of these drinks can be as high as 300 mg per serving. The recommended maximum intake of caffeine is 3 mg per kilogram per day. One can easily see how someone can effortlessly exceed their recommended caffeine intake with just a single energy drink. To make things worse, the cans seem to be getting bigger and bigger.<br><br><br>
A common argument is that many types of coffee contain the same amount of caffeine found in energy drinks. Be this as it may, coffee is typically drunk hot and therefore more slowly, allowing the body to cope with the side effects of the stimulant. However, energy drinks are typically served cold and drunk a lot faster, creating the risk of the body becoming overwhelmed with the rapid intake of caffeine. <br><br><br>
Although I mentioned that caffeine can have positive effects in an adult (in recommended doses), the combination of caffeine and alcohol can be fatal. Pre-mixed cocktails containing alcohol and energy drinks are commonly available and are popular among many young adults. One of the main issues here is that the combination of caffeine and alcohol leads to increased drinking per session than what would occur without the caffeine, due to its stimulant effects. Many people are under the impression that the caffeine counteracts the negative effects of alcohol, and so they think they are more in control of themselves. In fact, this is not true: the caffeine may prevent sleepiness but it does not reduce alcohol-induced impairment and so puts one at more risk of alcohol-related violence, sexual assault and car accidents. <br><br><br>
In the late stages of 2013, all energy drinks in South Africa suddenly appeared with a warning label, stating that the beverage is “not recommended for pregnant or lactating women, children under 12 years and persons who are sensitive to caffeine”. It seems the health authorities are starting to put their foot down a bit, but it may be too little, too late. The best thing you can do for your own health, and that of your children, is to be informed. I hope this article has achieved that.</div>
