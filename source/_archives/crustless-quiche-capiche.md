<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/crustless_quiche.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>This is a really quick dish to put together for dinner, just add a colourful salad to go with it. It also makes the perfect work or school snack - it keeps well in the fridge for at least 4 days.  <br><br>
You will need:<br><br>
- 6 x large eggs<br>
- 2 rounds of feta cheese<br>
- A large bunch of spinach, washed and chopped<br>
- 1 onion, diced<br>
- Olive/coconut oil or butter for frying<br>
- 1/2 cup of cream<br>
- Salt, pepper and mixed herbs<br><br>
Directions:<br><br>
1. Heat the olive/coconut oil or butter in a pot, and add the onion. Saute for 5 minutes. Add the spinach, and cook for just a few minutes until soft and wilted.<br><br>
2. Beat the eggs with the cream. Crumble the feta and stir it into the egg.<br><br>
3. Add the seasoning to the egg, and stir the spinach and onion in.<br><br>
4. Pour the mixture into a quiche dish (greased if necessary).<br><br>
5. Bake for 20 - 30 minutes at 180, or until set.<br><br>
