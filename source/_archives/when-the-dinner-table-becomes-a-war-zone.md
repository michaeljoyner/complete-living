<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/messybaby.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption">Expect things to get messy</p>My parents love to tell me how awful I was at meal times, and I clearly remember “Mr Manners” (a swift smack on the bum from my dad) having to pay me a visit a few times before I would just sit down and eat.<br>
So why are toddlers so difficult at meal times? First of all, their growth is starting to slow down, and so their appetite naturally decreases. At the same time, there is an explosion in the development of their senses and motor skills, and so all they want to do is explore and try new things! It is completely natural for a toddler to be distracted and show little interest in food at meal times.<br><br>
However, a lot of good food habits can be laid down at this stage of your child’s life. Try and keep these points in mind (when you are not tearing your hair that is):<br><br><br><span class="underLine">Help! My child never eats!</span><br><br>
The most important thing to bare in mind is that a toddler will never let themselves starve to death. This is because they have the innate ability to control their food intake according to their energy needs. For example a child may eat less on one day as compared to the next but over a the period of a week their average intake was constant. Unfortunately,  as they get older environmental factors such as peer pressure, food advertising and psychological links to food may disturb this ability, and so it should be nurtured for as long as possible. Parents who interfere with the ability to self-regulate food intake, by forcing the child to clean their plate or using food as a reward for good behaviour, are causing the child to over or under eat.  Never use food as a reward/punishment for good/bad behaviour – this causes the child to see food as something else other than fuel for his body. Rather use activities that the child enjoys.As long as they are growing normally (your paediatrician will be able to tell you this when you go for check-ups), you can be confident they are getting enough food. If you are worried whether it is the right types of food, and in the right amounts, seek the help of a dietician. <br><br><span class="underLine">Why does he scream every time I try and feed him??</span><br><br>
From the age of about 1 year, children learn to chew food laterally and not just in an “up and down” movement, and are now ready to handle chopped or soft foods.  At the same time, a child will develop the skill of the “pincer” movement with their hand, allowing them to pick up food. Self-feeding is a really important part of your child’s development and you should encourage it no matter how messy it gets. He may insist on feeding himself and even though you know it would take less than half the time if you just feed him, let him continue. This is your child’s first step in becoming independent from you, and it is important to encourage it.  Keep distractions, such as the TV, away at this time to allow your child to explore new tastes and textures. <br><br><span class="underLine">My child refuses to eat a food he happily ate a week ago...what is going on?</span><br><br>
Toddlers have the annoying (for the parents) habit of going through a stage of displaying food “jags”. This means that they suddenly refuse to eat a food they previously liked. Here is where a lot of parents make the mistake of not offering that food to the child again, and the child could grow up to never include that potentially very important food in his diet. Food jags are normal, and it is very important to keep offering the foods again and again. Your child’s curiosity will eventually get the better of him and he will try it. It may help to serve the disliked food with liked food. When it comes to trying new foods for the first time, toddlers are great imitators and are more likely to try it if they can see that the family are also eating it. Of course it also helps to serve new foods when the child is hungry.<br><br><span class="underLine">My child is such a picky eater, he never finishes his food...</span><br><br>
Small children need boundaries and limits set, and it is no different when it comes to meals. Establish regular but flexible meal and snack times, allowing enough time in between to allow the child to get hungry. Remember that because they are eating such small portions at any one time they will get hungrier faster than you and I would. It is very important that children be allowed to control the amount of food they eat based on their hunger levels, rather than parental pressure. <br>
Toddlers need toddler-sized portions.  A rule of thumb is one tablespoon of food per year of age. It is always better to serve a smaller portion than what you think the child will eat, and then let him ask for more. Parents often serve up amounts too big for the child to eat at one time and then label their child as a picky eater.  Small children cannot eat a large amount at once (their stomachs are very small), and so nutritious snacks in between meals are important. Take note of the word nutritious – allowing your child to snack on sweets and chips throughout the day will dampen their appetite when it comes to meal or snack time. It is really important to ensure your child is receiving a balanced and appropriate diet for his age – if you unsure of what this means, seek advice. A lot of conditions which may only occur in adulthood can be prevented through a good childhood diet.</div>
