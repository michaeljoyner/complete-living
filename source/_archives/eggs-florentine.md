<div>You decide to follow a low carb diet and so you ditch the muesli and toast. Great. But then you realise you actually don't have time in your packed morning to cook breakfast, what with trying to get yourself and your kids ready! <br><br>
Eggs Florentine is your answer. Just a few minutes prep, and then the dish can be left to cook, giving you enough time to get dressed and pack bags before sitting down to enjoy a satisfying breakfast. Bonus: it will keep you full for ages, preventing that mid-morning sugar crash!<br><br>
The dish will take even quicker to put together should you have left over veggies from the night before. Anything goes: spinach, mushrooms, peppers or anything your heart desires (or your fridge holds).<br><br>
It is really simple: place the leftover veggies (or chop some fresh ones), enough to cover the bottom of a small, greased casserole dish.<br><br><br>
Crack 2 - 4 eggs into the casserole dish, over the veggies. <br><br>
Grate about 30 grams (or one matchbox sized piece) of cheese.<br><br>
Sprinkle with plenty of black pepper.<br><br><div class="art_pic_wrapper">

<br><br>
Pop into a pre-heated oven at 220 degrees Celsius for about 10 -15 minutes (the longer you leave it, the harder the yolks become).<br><br>
Serve with low GI/seed toast for the kiddies, and just so for yourself.<br><br>
Enjoy!</div>
