<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/coconut_oil.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>You most likely grew up knowing that red meats, eggs, bacon and full cream dairy products should not be eaten excessively due to their high saturated fat and cholesterol content. Too much saturated fat and cholesterol leads to an increased blood cholesterol level, heart disease and heart attacks. You, like many other people, probably didn’t even question it. Science had shown this right? It is what all doctors and other health care professionals said, right?<br><br><br>
Nutritional research has come a long way but unfortunately a lot of our guiding principles have not been updated along with it. The whole saturated fat one is a perfect example. Are saturated fats and cholesterol as bad as they have been made out to be? This is an article for another day, but just very briefly, most studies showing any sort of association between saturated fat intake and blood cholesterol levels were short term studies and all but one long term study examining the relationship between the 2 have not shown any positive results (the one that did show a positive association was weak). In other words, saturated fat most likely does not cause raised blood cholesterol. To add fuel to the fire, it seems that raised blood cholesterol may not even be as strong a risk factor for heart disease as other things (such as inflammation levels and long term blood glucose control). But as I said, another article for another day….<br><br><br>
Back to the point: coconut oil. Yes it is a saturated fat source. But as explained already that may be no legitimate reason to avoid it. Different fats have different triglyceride lengths: short, medium and long. Nearly all of the fat we get in our diets is made up of long chain triglycerides. Coconut oil is predominantly made up of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT’s). This is what gives this oil its unique character. So, what is special about these MCT’s? <br><br><br>
MCT’s are absorbed differently to the more commonly eaten LCT’s. LCT’s are insoluble in water and require the use of bile to be digested and absorbed in the intestine. Once absorbed, these LCT’s are transported to our fat and muscle tissue for storage. However, MCT’s are handled completely differently. Because they are shorter, they can be directly absorbed into the liver where they are used for energy immediately (patients in hospital who have problems absorbing fat are often supplemented with MCT oil). In addition, MCTs do not play a role in the biosynthesis and transport of cholesterol. Because MCT's  are used right up and not stored like their LCT friends, there is some research to suggest that swapping LCT’s for MCT’s (s in other words swapping your canola or sunflower oil for coconut oil) boosts the metabolism and satiety and promotes weight loss. <br><br><br>
There are more benefits of coconut oil (granted these do still have to be backed up by sound studies):  lauric acid, present in coconut oil, when converted to something called monolaurin once ingested, has been found to have protective effects from infections. Caprylic acid, also found in coconut oil may have antiviral and antifungal effects<br><br>
. <br>
The effect of coconut oil on cholesterol levels is still under scrutiny (what is not under scrutiny in the nutrition field??). There is some evidence which indicates that substitution of coconut oil into the diet (and substitution of canola, sunflower or other seed oils out), increases the HDL (or the “good” cholesterol). However, there is also evidence to suggest that the LDL cholesterol (or the “bad” cholesterol) increases as well. But if one casts one’s mind back to one of my earlier articles, it seems that not all LDL cholesterol is created equally. LDL comes in different sizes, small dense particles and larger, more fluffy particles. It seems that the larger more fluffy particles are not atherogenic (or artery clogging), whereas the small dense ones are.  So does coconut oil raise the small nasty LDL particles or the large friendly ones? At this stage your guess is as good as mine. <br><br><br>
Before you rush out and buy gallons of coconut oil, take heed of the following: it is hard to say if coconut oil is “good” or “bad” for you – it all depends on what you take out of your diet, how much coconut oil you eat (remember it is really high in calories and so if you are ingesting a lot you may not reap the weight loss benefits), your genetics and your lifestyle. It is most likely safe to say that coconut oil is not as bad as it was made out to be some years ago (mostly because it may have been an American political decision to fiercely promote seed oils), but do not tout it as a magic cure….just yet. If you do decide to go ahead and start using coconut oil you will find it is versatile oil which can be used in any recipe and cooking. It can withstand high heats, and no it does not make everything taste like coconut - in fact it is pretty tasteless. Here is a handy guide to choosing which kind of coconut oil to buy:<br><a href="http://www.foodrenegade.com/how-to-choose-a-good-coconut-oil/">http://www.foodrenegade.com/how-to-choose-a-good-coconut-oil/</a></div>
