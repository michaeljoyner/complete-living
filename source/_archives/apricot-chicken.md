<br><br><span class="underLine">What you will need:</span><br><br>
6 – 8 chicken pieces, on the bone.<br><br>
3 – 4 different types of vegetables, chopped (I normally just use whatever I have in the fridge - an onion,  ½ a punnet each of mushrooms and courgettes and perhaps a pepper)<br><br>
175 g tub of plain yoghurt<br><br>
200 ml apricot juice<br><br>
1 sachet/50 g brown onion soup powder<br><br><br><span class="underLine">Directions:</span><br><br>
Pre-heat the oven to 180 C. Place the chicken pieces in a casserole dish, with the chopped vegetables surrounding it. Mix the yoghurt, fruit juice and brown onion soup powder together. Pour the mixture over the chicken and vegetables. Make sure the chicken pieces and the vegetables are all well-coated with the yoghurt mixture. Cook for 1 – 1 ½ hours. Serve with brown rice/cous-cous, or just with a salad if following a low carbohydrate diet.</div>
