<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/comrades_1.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>First of all, we need to examine if there are any other factors that could have improved my time apart from nutrition. In terms of mileage done, since my first Comrades in 2010 my overall mileage from January to race day has always been between 1000 and 1200 kilometres. So an increase in mileage cannot really be considered. However, the quality of my training should be considered as this is something that may have influenced my performance slightly – training with a group of runners faster and stronger than myself, and with a lot more experience, has definitely improved my fitness. In saying that, I don’t think it is completely down to the improved quality of training, as without the changes in my diet I don’t think this would have had nearly as significant an influence on Comrades day.<br><br>
On a day to day basis, I mostly maintained the principles of a LCHF diet by keeping my carbohydrate intake to roughly below 50 grams per day. Of course, there were several situations in which 50 grams was exceeded but this was most certainly not on a regular basis. The following is an example of a typical day:<br><br><span class="underLine">Breakfast:</span><br><br>
3 eggs, beaten with 15 ml cream, scrambled with spinach and mushrooms, with 30 g of cheddar cheese grated over OR 3 tablespoons of Greek yoghurt, 2 tsp macadamia butter, 1 tablespoon of raw nuts/seeds, 1 scoop of whey protein and half a serving of fruit.<br><br><span class="underLine">Snacks:</span><br><br>
Depending on what kind of training I had done in the morning and what kind of breakfast I had eaten, I may or may not have had a snack. If I did it was normally a piece of crustless quiche, a few raw nuts, some biltong, some raw veg with cream cheese or a piece of cheddar cheese.<br><br><span class="underLine">Lunch:</span><br><br>
Lunch was normally some leftovers from supper with veg or a salad with chicken/cheese/nuts/bacon/avo.<br><br><span class="underLine">Supper:</span><br><br>
Supper was usually a meal of protein (beef, pork, chicken or fresh tuna) with plenty of vegetables and a fat source of cream, coconut cream/oil, cheese etc.  <br><br><span class="underLine">Drinks:</span><br><br>
Plenty of water and roughly 4 cups of coffee and maybe 1 cup of tea. Coffee was often with cream instead of milk, tea normally with milk, and both without sugar or sweeteners.<br><br>
My weakness is dark chocolate and I love Lindt 90%. Most nights I would have 2 squares of this with a cup of tea or coffee before bed.<br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Training nutrition</span><br><br>
Any training runs 2 hours or less, I would run with water only. If I felt a bit hungry before the run I may have had a tsp or 2 of macadamia butter, otherwise coffee with a little cream would suffice. <br><br>
For longer training runs, I would have a Phat Girls Super Cookie or Phat Bomb for breakfast (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Phat-Girls/344293459112796?ref=bookmarks">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Phat-Girls/344293459112796?ref=bookmarks</a>). <br><br>
Depending on the length of the run, I may or may not have needed anything during. If I did, it would either be a Phat Girls mini Phat Bomb, a few macadamia nuts or a small bit of cheese.<br><br>
Post-training meals would be a normal LCHF day to day meal.<br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Comrades day nutrition</span><br><br>
Comrades is always an incredibly early start. My alarm went off at 3:15 am and by 3:25am I needed to have started on my breakfast. This is to ensure there is enough time to let the stomach settle before the gun goes. My breakfast was a cup of coffee with cream and a Phat Girls Super Cookie. Then, at roughly 5 am while standing in the starting pen, I had a Phat Girls Phat Bomb. From the start at 5:30 am to four and a half hours into the race (roughly 30-35 km run), I did not need to eat anything at all, and I just drank water. Because it was hot and I knew I was losing a lot of salt, I made sure to have a cup of home-made broth from my seconds at each of the occasions we saw them (at distances 29km, 39km and 58 km from the start). Once again, as I was in 2014, I was so impressed with how the broth made me feel. The broth is rich in minerals which have seeped from the bones it is made from, including the vital sodium I was losing. I also feel that the body benefits from the protein it provides. I did not make use of any electrolyte replacement sachets or capsules the entire race as the broth was more than adequate in ensuring my electrolytes and fluid levels were in balance. A huge benefit of this is the significant difference in price between home-made broth and commercial electrolyte replacements. <br><br>
The only solid foods I took in during the race was roughly 45 grams of cheddar cheese, a handful of macadamia nuts and 1 or 2 orange wedges. In comparison to traditional sports nutrition guidelines of taking in 30 – 60 grams of carbohydrates every hour, this is significantly smaller amount of food to eat, yet my energy levels were completely stable throughout the whole day. I cannot claim it was an easy run, I don’t think anyone could ever say that about the Comrades. However, I never had any episodes of nausea or vomiting or that feeling of “hitting the wall”. <br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Beware of trying to follow 2 different strategies:</span><br><br>
Although those against LCHF would say different, it has been said time and time again by LCHF advocates that not everyone who does long distance sports events needs to follow a LCHF diet. Many, many athletes do very well on a traditional diet and continue to use carbohydrates (and therefore glucose) as their main fuel source on race day. If you know how to do this properly and you re-fuel regularly to prevent hitting the wall then you should not run into any problems. However, There are a significant amount of people who battle with such a high amount of sugar (from the energy gels, sports drinks, jelly babies etc.) and do suffer from stomach problems, nausea and vomiting on race day. These often cause the person to be unable to stick to their nutrition plan, which may cause them to hit the wall later on. <br><br>
The benefit to following a well-formulated LCHF diet, and therefore being fat-adapted, is that you can never really run out of fuel, and so you have a much smaller chance of hitting the wall. The body only has a small amount of storage space for carbohydrates (which is why guidelines suggest having some every hour), whereas we all have thousands of calories worth fat stored within us. If you are fat-adapted you can draw on this energy to fuel you. This is the key though – if you are not fat adapted well before race day, you cannot expect your body to suddenly be able to draw on this energy source on race day. This is because your body is used to using glucose as its main fuel, and so you will need carbohydrates and if you don’t have them you will hit the wall. The length of time to become fat-adapted is individual but I would strongly suggest that if you plan to do an endurance event as a LCHF athlete, you need to do your training while following the diet as well.</div>
