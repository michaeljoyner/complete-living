<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/sweeteners.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>Sweeteners can be divided into 2 large categories: nutritive and non-nutritive. Nutritive sweeteners provide the body with calories, while non-nutritive provide zero or negligible calories.<br><br><span class="myHeading">Nutritive sweeteners</span><br><br>
Nutritive sweeteners are things such as sugar-alcohols, glucose, sucrose, fructose, galactose, maltose, corn-based sweeteners and agave nectar. Fruit, vegetables and dairy products inherently have natural sugars in them, and any sugar or sweetener added either by the manufacturer or by the consumer before ingestion is referred to as an added sugar. <br><br><br>
It goes without saying that we should do our best to avoid any form of added sugar. A high added sugar intake is linked with obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes among other chronic diseases. <br><br><br>
Nutritive sweeteners come in many shapes and forms…and names. Clever food manufacturers can make a food look a lot “healthier” than what it really is just by giving sugar a different name on the label. Some examples are: corn syrup, corn syrup solids, dextrose, fructose, high-fructose corn-syrup, honey, invert sugar, lactose, malt syrup, maltose, maple syrup, molasses and nectar. Get into the habit of reading labels to spot any of these names and do your best to avoid them. <br><br><br>
Let’s take a brief look at the 3 nutritive sweeteners that have gained the reputation of being “better choices” than regular sugar: fructose, agave nectar and xylitol.<br><br><span class="underLine">Fructose</span><br><br><br>
Recently fructose has been punted as being better than regular table sugar, especially for diabetics or those at risk for the development of diabetes. Normally, any carbohydrate eaten is digested into glucose. Fructose is the exception to this rule – it follows a different pathway and is metabolised as a fat. Yes, you read that correctly. Any form of fructose that we eat, whether it is from fruit, from honey or from high fructose corn syrup (that poisonous stuff found in Coke), gets made into fat by the liver. This is quite ironic as most energy and sports drinks have fructose in them – why put a sugar that cannot be metabolised for energy into a drink advertised for those in dire need of energy?<br><br>
Now what about honey? Honey is a source of fructose, so should you be avoiding it? That is a tricky one. Honey contains hundreds of compounds in it aside from fructose. It has some minerals, a few vitamins, amino acids, and reportedly some immune-boosting properties. Humans have been eating it for hundreds of years since it was first discovered – it is a whole food by any definition. Saying that, take into account it is also a sugar at the end of the day. It is most likely better for you than any other nutritive sweetener, but use it in moderation. Honey will also vary in its composition depending on where it comes from. Always choose raw honey as it has been least refined. <br><br>
High fructose corn syrup is an added sugar only available to food manufacturers. Please see the article entitled “sickeningly sweet” on how this is made and the detrimental effect it has on one’s health!<br><br><span class="underLine">Agave nectar</span><br><br>
Agave nectar is fast becoming popular as a better option to any other sugar. But just like honey, at the end of the day it is still a sugar. If one had to choose between agave nectar and honey, I would suggest the honey. Here is why:<br>
Agave nectar comes from the agave plant which, interestingly, is also used to make tequila. The core of this plant contains a liquid from which agave nectar is eventually made. I say the word eventually because the agave nectar you see in the shops has most likely gone through quite a refining process to get it into the form it is. The light agave nectar has a more delicate flavour while the darker one has a more caramel taste.<br>
One tablespoon of agave nectar has about 60 calories, while a tablespoon of regular sugar has about 40 calories. However, one would use less agave nectar because of its more intense sweetness. Saying that, it is still very close to sugar in its caloric value.<br>
But is it better for you? Probably not. As I said before, the agave nectar you can buy has gone through some serious processing to get it into that form. It is high in fructose, the drawbacks of which are explained above. <br><br><span class="underLine">Xylitol</span><br><br>
Xylitol is a sugar-alcohol which naturally occurs in most plant material. Sugar-alcohols provide very little calories, on average about 2 kcal per gram.  If taken at certain amounts, xylitol has been seen to be preventative towards the development of dental caries. It has received approval as a food additive, and it has a sweetness equal to that of regular sugar. Because it does not have an effect on the blood sugar levels, it does not cause a release in insulin. If taken in excessive amounts it can have a laxative effect, so watch out. <br><br><span class="myHeading">Non-nutritive sweeteners</span><br><br><br>
Ok so let’s get to the part most people are interested in: non-nutritive sweeteners. These are man-made sweeteners that provide zero or negligible calories.<br><br><br>
Non-nutritive sweeteners can be safely recommended to those needing to lose weight or control their blood sugar levels, if the person uses them as recommended and stays within the suggested amounts per day. If the non-nutritive sweeteners completely replace any form of added sugar, benefits of weight loss and of blood sugar control can be seen (it goes without saying that the quality of the rest of the diet is important – ordering a Coke Zero with that Big Mac is kind of pointless). <br><br>
Let’s start with the most controversial: <br><br><span class="underLine">Aspartame</span><br><br>
Aspartame is commonly used to sweeten “diet” drinks such as Coke Zero. It has been the subject of much controversy, with some nutrition experts saying its breakdown products are linked to cancer development and premature births. It has however been declared safe for general use by the Food and Drug Administration as well as the European Food Safety Authority. There are some folk who are still in disagreement, saying that the intakes used in the studies to prove its safety were too small. Currently the acceptable daily intake (ADI) is 40 mg per kg of body weight.  Aspartame has an incredibly intense sweetness and so a tiny fraction of it can be used to get the same sweetness as sugar. Brands of sweetener containing aspartame are Equal and some of the Canderal products. More and more companies tend to be stamping their products as “Aspartame free”, perhaps as the public awareness of the possible dangers of Aspartame increase. <br><br><span class="underLine">Stevia</span><br><br>
This non-nutritive sweetener is becoming increasingly popular, most likely due to its reputation of being "natural". Stevia glycosides are extracted from a plant and the Food and Drug Administration has given these a status of “Generally Recognised as Safe (GRAS)”. Whole stevia leaves, sometimes sold in health shops, have not received this same status.  GRAS means that experts have evaluated its safety and declared that there is reasonable certainty of no harm. Stevia has an intense sweetness but at above recommended amounts it takes on a bitter taste. There is some preliminary research to suggest that Stevia has a positive effect on blood sugar levels, although this research is in the very early stages. Stevia is found mostly in health shops, although it is becoming more commonly found in regular grocery stores as well. Canderal Green is made from Stevia. <br><br><span class="underLine">Saccharin</span><br><br>
Saccharin had a bad start to the world of non-nutritive sweeteners when in 1977 it was banned from use because of research linking it to the development of bladder cancer in lab animals. This ban was later lifted when studies showed that the mechanism of the cancer development had no relationship to the human body. Still, not such a great reputation to have. Now saccharin has the status of “reasonable certainty of no harm”. Limited studies have shown us that saccharin does not have a positive effect on blood sugar control, and so is probably not the best choice if your reason for use is blood sugar management. Saccharin is often used in combination with other sweeteners. <br><br><span class="underLine">Sucralose</span><br><br>
Sucralose is one of the most common artificial sweeteners. It can be purchased as sucralose tablets or powder, and is also used in a number of food and drink products. It has approval from the Food and Drug Administration as being safe for use. There is limited evidence that sucralose has a positive effect on weight loss and blood sugar control when substituted for sugar-containing products. However, some products use sucralose in combination with dextrose. Dextrose, being a type of sugar, will raise your blood sugar levels and so care must be taken in choosing products if glycaemic control is your aim. Examples of sweeteners containing sucralose are Canderal, Equal and Splenda. Note that one of the by-products of aspartame breakdown is phenylalanine, which can be dangerous to those with phenylketonuria (a condition of not being able to breakdown phenylalanine, which can become toxic once levels build up beyond a certain point).<br><br><span class="underLine">Acesulfame-K</span><br><br>
Acesulfame-K has received approval to be used in food and drinks as well as a general sweetener. It is mostly excreted in the urine, unchanged from its original form.<br><br><br>
So there you have it: the in’s and out’s of sweeteners. It is highly recommended to cut out all added sugars from your diet. This is important even for those who are not overweight or at risk for diabetes – they ill effect of sugar on the human body is becoming more and more apparent every day. Fascinating research indicates that sugar has the same effect on the brain as recreational drugs such as cocaine which suggests that it is habit which can be broken. I always advise my patients to try and break their addiction to sweetness in any form - that means cutting out sugar and artificial sweeteners. However, ff you can’t handle life without some added sweetness, make sure you use any of the artificial sweeteners in moderation – no matter how good for you they profess to be. As you can tell from this article there is a lot about them that needs to be uncovered.</div>
