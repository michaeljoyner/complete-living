<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/fishcakes_big.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>Unfortunately, most people don't eat enough omega 3 in their daily diet and tend to have too much omega 6. This imbalance between these essential fatty acids can cause a chronic state of inflammation throughout the body which can lead to the development of lifestyle diseases such as cancer and heart disease. <br>
Omega 3 is chock-a-block full of health benefits, such as protection from heart disease by lowering the level of triglycerides or "bad fats" in your blood, prevention of joint pain and arthritis, brain health (omega 3's are really important in children with ADHD), protection against Alzheimers and dementia and even depression. Now if these are not reasons to get your daily omega 3 intake, I am not sure what are! <br><br>
Omega 3 supplements don't come close in comparison to eating dark oily fish. Many supplements don't contain as much omega 3 as they claim to, and some may contain potentially harmful ethyl esters.  Ethyl esters are man-made molecules which are formed in the process of extracting and purifying fish oil, and some studies have linked them to being toxic to our cells. Lastly, the cost of supplements is much more than that of fish rich in omega 3!<br><br>
We recommend eating dark oily fish at least 2 - 3 times a week. Here are 3 fish cake recipes using salmon, pilchards and tuna to get you started!<br><br>
