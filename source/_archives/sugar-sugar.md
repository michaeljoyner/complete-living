<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/SugarPoison_1.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption">Sweet poison?</p>Have you ever watched the last hour of the Comrades Marathon?  Have you ever wondered how so many overweight people have managed to complete it?  One would think that people who are that fit (and believe me you have to be superbly fit just to be there) would all be lean and muscular.<br><br>
The truth is, it does not matter how much exercise you are doing, if you are not eating correctly, the weight will not budge even while running the 1000 plus kilometres required to get ready for Comrades.<br><br>
A healthy body is reliant 80% on what you eat and 20% on the exercise you do.<br><br>
It does not matter how many calories you are burning when you exercise because not all calories are born equal!  The bottom line is if you are ingesting too much sugar, you can run until you are blue in the face (or should that be red in the face?) and your weight is likely to stay the same.  <br><br>
And the scary thing is, of course, hidden sugars. Ever since it became the done thing to follow a low-fat diet, there has been a humongous surge in the amount of low-fat foods available. Next time you are in the grocery store, take note of how many things are labelled as low-fat. Manufacturers label it as such because they know it is a sure sale. What most people do not know however is that the minute one removes fat from food it becomes tasteless or even nasty-tasting.  How do they compensate for that?  You guessed it – sugar in some form or other is added. The problem is that is quite tricky just to check the label for sugar - there are many types of sugar, all with different and complicated sounding names.  It’s a minefield out there!<br><br><br>
Here are some tips to avoid this sugar overload:<br><br>
1.	You do not need a sports drinks (Such as Energade or Powerade) if you are training for less than 2 hours. I have seen people at the gym who half-heartedly stroll on the treadmill for 10 minutes, yet knock back a sports drink with gusto-definitely not the way to get into shape!  <br><br>
2.	If you are exercising for an hour or less in the early mornings, you do not need anything to eat or drink (besides water obviously) before you go out.  Make sure you have a healthy breakfast which includes protein, fats and a bit of low GI carbs when you get back.<br><br>
3.	Avoid “health”, “cereal”, “breakfast” or “sports” bars.  They are also normally loaded with sugar.<br><br>
4.	When choosing food, always choose the least-processed option – there is less chance of being tripped up by those hidden sugars.<br><br>
5.	I know this sounds crazy because the opposite has been drummed into our heads for so long, but always choose full fat dairy over the low fat dairy products.  You will find that you will eat less of the product because the fat makes you feel full quicker and you will not be hungry again so soon for the same reason.   Also, you will be avoiding the extra sugar that is added to low fat yoghurt to make it palatable.  In fact all flavoured yoghurts contain a lot of sugar – try the double cream Greek yoghurt and add your own sweetener.<br><br>
6.	Here’s another crazy thing – if you are trying to lose weight, limit fruit – I know, I know – we’ve always been told to fill up on fruit, but fruit is crammed with sugar – the fact that it is natural sugar makes no difference.  Have one piece of fruit but snack on things like biltong or a handful of nuts as well – no sugar there!<br><br>
Try and think about all the sugar that is in your daily diet and find ways to avoid that sugar – you will find that losing weight becomes easier and your exercise sessions more pleasurable.   It’s not easy – sugar is an addictive substance – but if you manage to get it right, your body will thank you for it.<br><br>
