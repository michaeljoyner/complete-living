Your gut is the hub of your immune system, as this is where the majority of your immune-modulating cells are housed. Thus, a healthy gut equals a strong immune system. There are a few ways you can make sure your gut is in tip-top shape:<br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Vitamin D</span><br><br>
Your vitamin D level needs to be between 30 – 80 ng/ml. Vitamin D plays a crucial role in maintaining gut integrity (not to mention its other important roles) and so if you have levels toward the lower end of the normal range or below the normal range, consider a Vitamin D supplement. <br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Probiotics and fermented foods</span><br><br>
Probiotics are microbial food supplements, normally in the form of capsules or powder, which provide the gut with live microorganisms. Sounds yukky, but these bugs are vital in keeping our gut functioning properly. The more good bacteria you have living in your gut, the less chance bad bacteria (that make you sick) have of surviving. It may not be essential to take a probiotic supplement on a daily basis for the rest of your life – the idea is to use a probiotic supplement to get the good bacteria up to an adequate level and then keep them there by following a well-formulated diet. This should include fermented foods. Fermented foods are a source of probiotics. Examples of fermented foods include sauerkraut, yoghurt (as long as the cultures are live and active at the time of eating), kefir (a cultured milk drink made from kefir grains and milk), kombucha (a tangy, effervescent tea) and fermented vegetables. <br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Collagen and gelatin</span><br><br>
Gelatin is the cooked version of collagen, which you find in those sinewy bits of meat attached to the bones you normally chuck out or bypass in the supermarket. Don’t do that anymore! Use them to make a broth (look out for a recipe here soon). Using bones (beef, pork, game, mutton or chicken) to make a bone broth is incredibly nutritious (not to mention really inexpensive), not just because of all the nutrients that get seeped out of the bones during cooking, but because of the conversion of the collagen into gelatin. You will know your broth is gelatin-rich if it turns jelly-like in the fridge. The gelatin is important for the health of the gut lining and the permeability of your gut. Good gut permeability means that what is meant to stay in the gut does, and doesn’t move through into the systemic circulation causing inflammation. Bone broth is incredibly nourishing for a variety of reasons and should be a diet staple – sip on it as is, or use it as a base for soups. <br><br><span class="mySubHeading">Get in your greens</span><br><br>
We know that our immune-modulating cells (the cells that control the immune system) are found in the lining of our gut. It is thought that a specific gene is responsible for the optimal functioning of these immune cells and that this genes responds to specific foods, one of these being dark green vegetables. So get in that spinach, kale, broccoli, collards, Swiss chard, romaine lettuce and cabbage. If you grow these yourself – even better.  <br><br><span class="underLine">Stay hydrated</span><br><br>
By this, I don’t mean sip on juices, coffee’s or cool drinks, I mean good old plain water. It can be still, sparkling, in black tea form or flavoured with some lemon juice, but water is important for ensuring your white blood cells (disease and infection fighting cells) are able to be transported efficiently throughout the body. Keep a bottle on your desk, and each time you go for a re-fill of coffee, make sure you drink at least half a glass of water first.<br><br><span class="underLine">Get in those ZZZZZZZ's</span><br><br>
The immune system repairs itself while we are sleeping; not enough sleep or poor quality sleep therefore does not allow time for this to happen.  Start to wind down an hour before you want to be asleep, by doing something relaxing such as reading, having a warm bath or listening to calming music. Avoid bright lights, computer screens and TV – these stimulate your brain. Try and get into bed at the same time each night even if you know you are not going to fall asleep for a while – this is part of training your body. Make sure you get minimum 6 hours of sleep each night, although 7 – 8 is preferable. <br><br><span class="underLine">Stress less</span><br><br>
4.	Stress less<br>
Easier said than done these days, I know, but do what you can to reduce your stress levels. Stress has a massive impact on your immune system, making you more susceptible to getting sick. Learn to say no to things that increase your work and stress load, burn off pent-up frustration by doing some exercise, talk to someone to share your concerns or problems, use a journal to manage your thoughts and change your outlook on life – thinking positive thoughts brings a positive mind-set. <br><br>
Have a happy-flu-free winter!</div>
