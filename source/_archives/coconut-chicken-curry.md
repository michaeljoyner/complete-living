If you would like to serve it with cauliflower mash (delicious-ness guaranteed!) here is the recipe:<br><br>
1 head of cauliflower, chopped with as much of the stem removed<br>
1 TBSP butter<br>
150 ml of cream<br>
salt and pepper<br><br>
1. Steam the cauliflower until soft.<br><br>
2. In a food processor, or using a stick blender, process the cauliflower and add the butter and the cream at the same time. You may find you need more or less cream to get your preferred consistency so don't add all at once.<br><br>
4. Season and serve,</div>
