<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/butternut,_spinach_and_mince_1.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption"></p>You will need:<br><br>
- 500 g quality beef or pork mince<br>
- olive oil<br>
- salt, pepper and mixed herbs<br>
- half a large butternut / 1 small butternut, cubed with the skin left on<br>
- 1 large bunch of spinach, cut up<br>
- 1 onion, diced<br>
- 2 cloves of garlic, diced / 2 teaspoons of crushed garlic<br>
- Half a punnet of mushrooms, sliced<br>
- 1 red pepper, diced<br>
- 410 g tin of tomato puree<br>
- 50 ml red wine<br>
- 3/4 cup of cheese, grated<br>
- 125 ml cream (may need some milk as well to thin the sauce if necessary)<br>
- 1 tablespoon of butter<br>
- 1 tablespoon of corn flour (if you have a way of making a cheese sauce with no flour, by all means do that. Otherwise, corn flour is gluten free and because you are using such a little for a large dish, it only provides a small amount of carbohydrates).<br><br>
Directions:<br><br>
1. Place your butternut in a large baking/casserole dish, sprinkle some olive oil and sea salt over and place in an oven pre-heated to 180 until the butternut is cooked through (about 30 - 40 minutes)<br>
2. While your butternut cooks, place the onions and garlic in a saucepan on a medium heat with some olive oil and soften. Add the mushrooms and red pepper and soften.<br>
3. Add the mince and let it brown. Once browned add the tin of tomato puree and the red wine. Add salt, pepper and mixed herbs. If you like some heat, add some fresh or dried chili now. Cook the mince for about 15 minutes on a low heat.<br>
4. Take the butternut out from the oven and layer the shredding spinach on top of it. Then pour the mince over the spinach and smooth evenly across the dish.<br>
5. Make your cheese sauce: add the butter to a hot saucepan, once melted add the flour and cream. Stir using a whisk to get rid of lumps. Here is when you may need to add extra milk to thin it out a bit. Then add the grated cheese and stir until melted and smooth. Your sauce should be thin enough to spread but not too thin so that it diappers into the mince - it must sit on top of the mince. Spread the cheese sauce over the mince<br>
6. Place the dish back in the oven (still at 180) and bake for about 20 minutes until the edges are golden and crispy.</div>
