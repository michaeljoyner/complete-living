<div><img src="/assets/images/articles/banting_baking.jpg" alt=""><p class="caption">Banting-friendly but beware</p>I have heard many people say that they have loved following the Banting diet because they can still have cakes, biscuits and other baked treats made with Banting - friendly ingredients.  It is often the first thing new Banters do: rush out to stock their cupboards with coconut flour, almond flour, xylitol and all the other Banting baking requisites.  You can find a Banting alternative for nearly every sweet treat out there: Banting cakes, Banting muffins, Banting chocolate, Banting jam....the list goes on.<br><br><br>
This is not a problem if you are making or buying these goodies on the odd special occasion, and it's less of a problem if you are following the diet for reasons other than weight loss or you have already reached your ideal weight. <br>
It does become a major problem if you are battling to lose weight, regulate your blood sugar or are relying on these products as a daily fix for your sugar cravings. Here is why:<br><br><br>
The Banting friendly flour alternatives (normally recipes call for coconut and/or almond flour) are incredibly calorie dense. Compare almond flour to regular cake flour: almond flour has almost 600 calories and 52 g of fat per 100 grams while cake flour has 340 calories and 1.5 g of fat. So yes, you are eliminating the dense carbs and gluten that cake flour provides but chances are you will eat beyond your bodies calorific needs, because you are eating a moreish cake/muffin/biscuit.  At the end of the day, calories do still matter and you are unlikely to see the weight loss you hope for. <br><br><br>
Secondly, the Banting diet is all about focusing on whole and real foods. It's almost like vegetarian versions of meat patties and sausages - what is the point of avoiding meat if you are trying to simulate it with something else?<br><br><br>
Lastly, and most importantly,  Banting is about avoiding the number one enemy: sugar. It is an addiction and that needs to be accepted. The first few days and weeks of Banting are meant to be difficult and you will go through sugar withdrawals. This is normal. You will make it much much harder for yourself if you continue to precipitate your addiction to sugar by eating sugar-free-but-still-sweet foods. <br><br><br>
So, get rid of all the Banting baked goodies and learn to eat a well formulated Banting diet, made up of a moderate amount of high quality protein, plenty of vegetables,  good quality and a variety of fats and very limited naturally sweet foods such as fruit, and your ideal weight will naturally follow. The key here is a well-formulated diet.  There are a lot of mistakes people can make when following the diet: too much protein, too much dairy, a lack of micronutrients and hidden carb sources are some of these mistakes- seek advice to avoid these.</div>
