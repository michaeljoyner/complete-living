Make sure you buy good quality pork sausages and not over-processed ones filled with cereals and other unknown substances. If you don't eat pork, chicken sausages will work just as well. <br><br>

2 tablespoons of castor sugar<br>
125 ml water<br>
Salt, to taste<br>
Pepper, to taste<br>
A good pinch of dried chili flakes<br><br><br>
Directions:<br><br>
1. fry the sausages in coconut/canola oil until cooked enough to slice into rounds. Keep aside sliced sausages for now.<br><br>
2. In a saucepan, saute the onion. Add the mushrooms and pepper and saute.<br><br>
3. Add the tin of tomatoes and simmer gently.<br><br>
4. In a measuring jug, add the water, soya sauce, vinegar, castor sugar, flour, salt, pepper and chili flakes and mix together well.<br><br>
5. Add the sauce to the saucepan, and add the sausages back in.<br><br>
