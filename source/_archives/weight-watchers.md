Think of a body builder. They tend to have extremely low body fat levels, right? But if a body builder had to stand on a scale his weight would be really high. So his weight would be high but he is not fat. There are 2 reasons for that: firstly muscle weighs a lot more than fat tissue, and secondly looking at weight as the only measure of weight loss/gain is like looking at a small part of a much bigger picture.<br><br><br><span class="mySubHeading">So what does "weight" mean then?</span><br><br>
When you stand on the scale, the number reflected back at you is how much your entire body weighs; it is the sum total of your bone, your muscle, your tissue, your body water and your fat mass. <br><br>
Weight is easily influenced by many things; for example your hydration levels, when last you ate, whether you have been to the toilet or not and hormonal levels. <br>
This may explain why your weight can change within a few kilograms in a matter of days which can be heart breaking for someone who has been sticking to a healthy diet and exercising regularly. Here is the good news: those changes are not necessarily a reflection of you getting “fatter”.  <br><br><span class="mySubHeading">So how do I keep track of my progress?</span><br><br>
First of all you need to think in terms of your ratio of lean muscle tissue to fat mass. That is way more significant than the number you see when you stand on the scale. The best way to do this is to use a body composition scale, such as the one I use for my clients. This type of scale gives more than just your weight; it also tells me your lean muscle mass and your body fat %. The goal is to get your body fat % as low as possible (within the normal healthy range) and your lean muscle mass as high as possible (again, within the normal healthy range). I always tell my clients to never weigh themselves more than once a month at home, and even then they should only do it if they can’t get to me to use my body composition scale. <br><br>
Now you know there is no reason to put yourself through the torture of standing in that dreaded scale every week!<br><br>
