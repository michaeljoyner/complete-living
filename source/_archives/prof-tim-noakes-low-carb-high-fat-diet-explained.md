I was recently lucky enough to attend a talk given by Professor Tim Noakes on why a low carbohydrate, high fat (LCHF) diet is what we should all be eating. Most of what he had to say is in his latest book, Challenging Beliefs, which I have read, but it was nonetheless still thoroughly interesting. <br><br>
Promotion of a low fat diet is ingrained in me, which is easy to understand considering what I studied.  As crazy as a LCHF diet may sound to some, it has to be said that he makes a very good case for it. Everyone, both health professionals and the public, need to be aware that what we all have been taught or told may not be the best solution. Considering the fact that levels of obesity, diabetes and other chronic illnesses are constantly increasing, we have to be open to the possibility that what we are currently doing is not helping, and open our mind to other options…..<br><br><br>
What follows is a summary of what Prof Tim Noakes has to say on the topic and some of my thoughts:<br><br>
As a dietician, like all other medical and health professionals, we learn from day one that the prudent diet (a diet which recommends that 50 – 60 % of our food is carbohydrates, that we limit fats, and that we choose vegetable fats over animal fats) is the diet to recommend. We are told it is proven to be the healthiest way of eating, especially for the heart. Based on the thought that certain fats raise cholesterol deposition in the blood vessels and therefore cause heart disease, replacing fats with carbohydrates is said to be heart-protective. We are also taught that obesity is caused by consuming too many calories and not doing enough exercise. This energy in-energy out model is used worldwide to explain obesity and is used as a basis to promote calorie-restricted diets and exercise to overweight and obese patients.<br><br><br>
The 1977 US Dietary Guidelines for Americans were one of the first set of guidelines designed to encourage the public to follow the prudent diet. Since the development of these, both American and local dietary guidelines have not deviated much. The latest South African Food Based Dietary Guidelines state that South Africans should eat mostly carbohydrate foods, and that fat should be used sparingly, with the emphasis on vegetable fats over animal fats. <br><br><br>
There is now a substantial body of evidence, described in precise detail in Gary Taubes’ book entitled “Good Calories, Bad Calories” that, for various reasons, these guidelines seemed to have been based on incomplete, and sometimes weak, science. Sadly, when studying dietetics, we were never informed about any of it. <br><br><br>
Since the development of those 1977 guidelines, the food manufacturing industry has been having a grand old time. Labelling anything as “low fat” was a sure sale, and the intake of processed foods, as long as they were low fat, began to rise. With the cutting down of fat, there became a gap in the public’s diet, and carbohydrates filled this gap. Although fat was being eaten less, refined carbohydrates and sugar were being eaten in larger and larger quantities. Prof Noakes emphasises the addictiveness of carbohydrates-once you start eating them, you literally can’t stop. He also feels that this addictiveness has essentially made us oblivious to our body’s signals- we no longer listen to our bodies to know when we are really hungry, instead we eat because we are addicted. <br><br><br>
In both “Challenging Beliefs” and “Good calories, Bad calories”, evidence to show an increase in obesity, diabetes and other chronic conditions since the development of the 1977 guidelines is described. According to Noakes and Taubes, for more than 30 years the so-called healthy prudent diet has been killing people. <br><br><br>
The theory behind the success of the LCHF diet is that, according to the Professor, the body has no need at all for carbohydrates. The end products that carbohydrates are broken down into, and their functions, can be provided and completed by protein and fats. By eliminating carbohydrates from the diet, the body is totally reliant on fat for energy. This obviously leads to weight loss, and also somehow regulates hunger. The off-shoot of this is that because you are not eating carbohydrates your blood sugar levels are not increasing nearly as much after meals, which is why Prof Noakes highly recommends this diet for diabetics. According to Noakes, it is the constant peaks in our blood sugar (as a result of eating a high amount of carbs) that causes damage to our blood vessels and ultimately heart disease. <br><br><br>
Unfortunately, pharmacology does not offer cures for chronic conditions-there are pills to control diabetes, pills to control high blood pressure, but no pills to cure diabetes or high blood pressure. However, Noakes is convinced that a LCHF diet can cure these conditions. He mentions that anecdotes are often said to be unacceptable in the scientific world, yet these are often the best controlled trials. Amongst others, he tells the story of a man, originally weighing 160 kilograms with diabetes and high blood pressure, who lost 80 kilograms and cured himself of those conditions in 7 months by following Prof Noakes guidelines. Prof mentions his own success with the diet, having lost a massive amount of weight, controlling his blood sugar levels and running faster than he did in his twenties. <br><br><br>
You may be thinking to yourself: “what about my cholesterol levels? Surely if I eat a lot of fat my cholesterol levels will go up and I will have a heart attack”?  According to Noakes, “cholesterol is not the unique cause of heart disease and may not even be an important factor”. As you read earlier on, the prudent diet is based on the theory that a high fat intake causes your blood cholesterol to rise. However Noakes points out in his book that there is no definitive evidence to say that reducing the fat intake in the diet prevents heart disease. In fact, a prudent diet can decrease the amount of HDL cholesterol (often referred to as the “good” or heart protective cholesterol) and increase the amount of triglycerides, increasing your risk of heart disease. Apparently, a LCHF diet has the opposite effect, protecting you from heart disease. Stronger risk factors for heart disease than cholesterol are in fact diabetes, high blood pressure and smoking. <br><br><br>
As intrigued by this diet I am, I still have some questions:<br><br>
-What is the sustainability of a diet like this? With limited food choices, it would be very easy to get bored, go back to old ways of eating, and potentially put on more weight than what was lost. <br><br>
-The poorer population are generally the ones that suffer the most from chronic diseases and obesity. How are they expected to be able to afford to eat a LCHF diet? How could we possibly change our food production and agricultural systems to accommodate this diet? The bottom line is that carbohydrate products, such as maize, are the cheapest to produce.<br><br>
-What are the risks for vitamin and mineral deficiencies? <br><br>
-Is there not a risk for constipation, with such a low fibre intake?<br><br>
Saying that, I definitely don’t think dieticians, other health professionals or the public can ignore Noakes, Taubes or any other LCHF advocates. They may very well be onto something and it could provide the answer to the constant increase in obesity, diabetes and other chronic illnesses, which if we don’t do anything about are bound to cripple our health systems. <br><br>
As I learn more about this enthralling topic, I will post more articles. <br><br>
